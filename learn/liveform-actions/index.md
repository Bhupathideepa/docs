### live form actions

can define **buttons** using the tab. By default, six actions are provided categorized based upon the behavior of the Form. They are:

- Edit mode - , and actions of which cancel and save in are pre-selected.
- View mode - , and actions.

each action button, you can specify the

- ;
- ;
- ;
- to be performed on click: These actions can be form actions like cancel,Â save and view; or navigation events; or any API invocation. **events** can be handled for a single Action.
- of button -
    - or
    - ;
- to hide the button from the form
- an icon to be displayed on the button.

Form Events can be triggered from actions outside the Live Form, i.e. a button placed outside the Live Form template can trigger a form save the event. [![](../assets/lf_events.png)](../assets/lf_events.png)

action functionality can be added by clicking on the **ADD** button, against the respective category. Once the action is specified a code snippet will be created in the JavaScript which can be used to code the desired action. The Action will be a JS function as shown below. Here we have written a function to display an alert dialog. The name of the function is the action field entry in the custom button created earlier.

 = function(){ 
        alert("hello");
   };
