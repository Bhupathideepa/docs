### Other Bugs

- Fixed an issue related to REST API OAuth 2.0 pop-up, requesting to re-authenticate on a new tab. 
- Fixed an issue related to the Autocomplete widget inside the Form, including the dropdown not showing in runtime when the web service with a Request body is bound to autocomplete widget.
