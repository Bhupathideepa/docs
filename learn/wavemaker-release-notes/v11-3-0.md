### Prefab Marketplace

WaveMaker now allows you to **Publish** Prefab to Marketplace and **Consume** Prefabs that are published by different teams. This furnishes independent software vendors to achieve productivity by enabling developers to reuse each other's code through this platform; this as well enables you to explore Prefabs and discover different teams for collaboration.

#### Semantic Versioning of Artifact

By allowing Publish to Marketplace, WaveMaker enables the use of Semantic Versioning for artifact publishing. This is a globally recognized standard for publishing package models, allowing the developers to track versions for software integration and more.
