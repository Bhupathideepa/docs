### Upgrading to Angular 10

- With Angular ending support for Angular 9, we upgrade to the next Angular version, 10.2.5.
- This Angular update requires you to take action: 
    1. Update Node version to 12.22.3
    2. Update NPM version to 6.14.13

For more information, or help, read the blog [Announcement about Angular 10 Update](/learn/blog/2021/09/01/angular-10-update).

## Improvements

- Show or hide all the hidden widgets on a page using a toggle button, located on the top menu. When you toggle to show hidden elements, all the hidden widgets in canvas show an overlay.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue related to autozoom selection in Google Maps of all types.
- Fixed an issue related to the Select widget when the boolean value of the Required validation is set to false. 
- Fixed an issue related to deploying an app with the Angular build, precisely when the app contains a Data Table widget, which shows a 403 error.
