## Performance Improvements

- Dialogs now load their content only when you click them to open. This helps web pages with many complex dialogs load faster
- Bind Dialog and Tab Loading: Tabs in the bind dialog now load only when needed, improving navigation speed and overall performance
- Web pages with many dialogs, containing a lot of Widgets and Prefabs will now load and perform better with lazy loading; dialog content only loads when the dialog is clicked
- Prefabs load faster; reducing the number of calls needed to access properties and configuration files
- Optimized Angular builds to reduce the size of the generated application files (like `vendor.js` and `main.js`); the studio loads noticeably faster


## Accessibility Enhancement with Label Widgets

WaveMaker improves accessibility by using semantic tags like `<p>` and `<h1>â€“<h6>` instead of `<label>` tags outside of forms. This change ensures compliance with accessibility standards.
