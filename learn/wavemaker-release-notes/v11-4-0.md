WaveMaker has released version 11.4.0, which includes new features like Core project and a few React Native features, such as a toggle option in Web Preview, Live Form, and Database Variables. This release has many enhancements like support for language fonts, indication mark in the Select widget, and so on along with bug fixes.  

### Deprecating WaveMaker 10 Projects

With 11.4 release, we bring new and enhanced features in our studio and will be ending our support to WaveMaker 10 projects. All the 10.x projects will be auto-migrated to our latest version i.e.11.4. To understand more, see [Ending Support to WaveMaker 10 Projects](/learn/blog/2023/08/11/wavemaker10x-end-of-support).

## New Features

### Core and Impl Projects

A **Core Project** (CORE) in WaveMaker is a template that contains the common functionality of an application. Multiple team members can work on it before deploying it. 

**Implementation Project** (IMPL) can be created as child project of the CORE project to add more features or customizations to IMPL. Changes made to the CORE project can be pulled into the IMPL projects periodically.

Example: 
- The **Core Project** is like a house blueprint.
- The **Implementation Projects** are like the different houses that are built based on the blueprint.

:::note
Core and Implementation Projects are currently in beta and can be accessed upon request through our Support team.

### API ReImport Impact Analysis

Typically, re-importing an API in an application can affect the application's behavior due to the API update.

The **API ReImport Impact Analysis** feature provides a detailed report on how updating a target API can affect the application's program elements, such as widgets, variables, and more. Impact analysis report can greatly improve the developer experience, especially during iterative development.

API ReImport Impact Analysis is currently in beta and can be accessed upon request through our Support team.

### New in React Native

#### Turn On/Off Web Preview

Introduced a toggle option to view the application in web preview. This option allows you to either preview it directly else use the given cli command to preview it in the local environment. To know more, see [Local Web Preview](/learn/react-native/generate-web-preview-locally/).

#### Database Variables

Introducing the Database CRUD variables in the React Native platform of WaveMaker Studio allowing users to connect an individual database entity through auto-generated CRUD APIs. Learn more about [Database Variables](learn/app-development/variables/database-crud/).
