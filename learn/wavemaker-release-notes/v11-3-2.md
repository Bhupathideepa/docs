WaveMaker has released a patch version, 11.3.2, containing bug fixes. 

---

## React Native Enhancements

- Define animations in a React Native app through JavaScript. Learn more about how to apply [React Native Animations](/learn/react-native/animations).
- Apply `linear-gradient` to the background of a widget through CSS `background-image`, see the reference in the example below: 
    ```css
    background-image: linear-gradient(120deg, #f6d365 0%, #fda085 100%);
    ```
- Grid Layout and Video Widgets are now supported in React Native apps.
- Navigate between Tab Panes using Swipe Gesture. Swipe Gesture works in mobile, but not in web preview.
- Use Flipper to debug WaveMaker applications. For more information, see [Flipper](/learn/react-native/flipper).

### Deprecated

- Layout and Flex Layout widgets have similar functionality; therefore, the Layout widget is no more supported, and it is removed from the widget's list.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed the positioning of columns' Summary Row issue.
- Fixed the Blob data type issue for Cordova apps where the images were not rendering in the devices as expected.
- Fixed the Material 2.0 theme where the slider buttons are cropped in the List widget pagination.
- Provided a fix for assigning server path port number when creating build.
