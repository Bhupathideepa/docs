### Filter Properties

- You can specify the number of records to be fetched via the **Page Size** property of the Live Filter. By default, this value is set to 20.
- Each of the field in the Live Filter can be selected and properties set. The **Input Type** property can be used to set the type of data user is required to enter. This will enforce basic validations to be performed on the values entered by the user.

### Filter Advanced Settings

**Live Filter Settings** can be changed from here. These include:

- **Auto Complete** and the **Caption** properties of _Align, Position, and Size_.
- _Collapsible_ and _Expanded_ options will allow you to expand and collapse the Live Filter like a panel widget.
- **Empty Filter Options** property can be used to enable '_No Value_' option for select and radioset widgets in **Live Filter**. The various sub-options define the behavior in case No Value is selected by the user. The options are:
    - NULL: Filtering on 'No Value' returns null records.
    - EMPTY: Filtering on 'No Value' returns empty records.
- **Filter on input change** will trigger the filter automatically when any of the filter field values change
