## New Features

---

### Teams Artifacts

- Support for Artifacts in the Teams portal, including publishing, approval, consuming of Prefabs with a new flow.
- Choose version-specific updates.

### Enhanced Properties Configuration

Updated property sources in the environment to support dynamic property configuration.

- Support for normalized system environmental variables. 
- Support for custom Bootstrap property source and dynamic property source.

### Query Modification in Entity Pre-fetch Event Listeners

- When external changes are made to the DB schema, the respective changes get reimported, which regenerates the code to keep the code and schema in sync.

### Library Update

- Updated [backend framework](#back-end-frameworks) libraries.
- Update Maven plugin versions to the latest ones in project the `pom.xml` file.
- Maven updated from 3.6.3 to 3.8.1. 

:::important
Maven 3.8.1 does not allow communication to HTTP repositories for security reasons, which may break the maven build in some projects. Project declaring JasperReports dependency with versions lower than 6.17.0 will fail because they internally declared an HTTP repository. In such cases, the dependency version should be updated to the latest version, which is 6.17.0.
:::

### Other Improvements

- Load a tab and accordion dynamically using a Live variable.

---

- Improved scalability when using multiple Prefabs on a single page.
- Fixes for WaveMaker 9.4 project themes.

- Fixed an issue related to zooming of Google Map Prefab when the map is present in a tab-pane or accordion.
