With the 11.8.1 release, we introduced significant changes to our release notes, enhancing transparency, readability, and ensuring timely availability of detailed information. We took it a step further with the 11.8.3 release, providing customers with all the necessary information two days ahead of the release.

## Customer Feedback

Our customers expressed the need for more detailed release notes to better understand how each update impacts their applications, use cases, and overall experience. This feedback motivated us to make significant improvements to our release notes.

## Our Actions towards Improvement

1. To ensure transparency in platform updates, we now include detailed information about every improvement, bug fix, and library upgrade.

Here, we can see the detailed information about a bug fix.

Now, we can not only find the major library upgrade details but also the minor library upgrade details.

2. Starting with the 11.8.1 release, we began providing comprehensive details on features, improvements, and bug fixes. These include descriptions of the fixes, their impact, images illustrating the before-and-after scenarios, and videos demonstrating features and their implementation.

Wherever applicable, we have also emphasized the Impact of an enhancement or a bug.

3. To improve readability, we’ve introduced a collapsible view for each feature, enhancement, and fix, making it easier for users to navigate. Users can quickly see a brief overview of each update and click to expand for full details. This allows users to focus only on the relevant information without having to go through unrelated information.

For example, the Bug Fixes section now appears in the below format.

4. Prior to release 11.8.1, we published release notes a day after the upgrade, along with all necessary documentation and links. Starting with 11.8.1, we began releasing notes on the same day as the upgrade, ensuring users could easily access all relevant information at the time of the update.

With 11.8.3, we’ve taken this a step further by publishing upcoming release notes two days before the upgrade, allowing users to prepare in advance. The final release notes were then published on the day of the upgrade, helping users stay informed and avoid any potential confusion.
