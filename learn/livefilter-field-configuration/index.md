### filter fields display options

**Fields** can be set from the tab of **Settings** property. Using this option you can select the columns for display on the Live Filter. Ordering can also be changed by using the buttons at the bottom of the designer window. Further, you can set:

- **on Field** property can be used to set a cascading filter. For example for the values displayed in the city field should depend upon the state value selected, then for city field, filter on field property should be set to state.
- the type to be _, select, checkboxset or radioset_ and much more. For date-type field, the _widget_ can be set and the _pattern_ can be selected
- numeric fields, it can be a **filter**, in which case the user has to enter the range of values to set the filter on,
- **Class** can be specified for each field, similar to the way it is done for columns in a data table.
- create **columns** by clicking on the ‘+’ icon. All the above-mentioned properties are available for custom columns.
- a field of string type, an additional property called **Mode** will define how the filter should be applied. The values can be:
    -   for matching the beginning of the string,
    - for matching the ending of the string,
    - for matching any part of the string, or
    - for matching the entire string;
- **criteria** can be applied to referenced entities for Inline Editable and Quick Edit Data Tables ( [here for usage](http://pm.wavemaker.com/learn/how-tos/using-filter-criteria-for-a-data-and-live-widgets/)).
