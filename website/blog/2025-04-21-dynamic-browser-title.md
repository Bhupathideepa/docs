WaveMaker Studio now features dynamic browser titles, enhancing navigation and usability. Introduced in [version 11.11.0](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v11-11-0/), this update allows the browser tab title to reflect the current module, page, or action within the Studio, providing immediate context and making it easier to manage multiple open tabs.

This enhancement is to improve developer user experience by providing immediate context and making it easier to manage multiple open tabs.
