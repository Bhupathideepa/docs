<details><summary>Resetting Individual Form Field</summary>

Previously, users were able to reset all the fields in the Form with the reset button. Now, the users can also reset the invidual fields in the Form without having to disturb the other fields.

For example, the below code can be used in the Script to create a button to reset only the **CheckNumber** field in the Form.

```js
Page.Widgets.SearchForm.formWidgets['CheckNumber'].reset();
```

## React Native Fixes

<details><summary>Changing Donut Chart Center Label Programtically</summary>

In Donut Chart, the center label is used to describe either the values in each slice of the Donut chart or the title of the Chart. Now, the users can style the center label using the `.app-donut-chart-centerlabel` CSS class.

<details><summary>Display Value Property in Number type Form Field</summary>

The value given in Number widget is by default taken as Data value, which can be masked using Display value. Now, users can use displayValue property to add a Display value in the Form field of number type.

Previously the user was unable to logout of the application when OpenID is applied as the aunthenticator and the CSRF was enabled in the security settings. The user was able to logout only when the CSRF was disabled. This issue was abserved because of the missing CSRF token in the logout API call.
