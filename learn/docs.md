[WaveMaker](https://www.wavemaker.com/) is a low-code platform for developing enterprise apps. It is a design studio with over [80 widgets](/learn/app-development/widgets/widget-library) that work out-of-the-box for developing a rich and modern end-to-end application. Simply drag-and-drop UI components on the dashboard and integrate it with data and services. 

:::tip
UI component are specified as widgets. To explore, see the [widgets documentation](/learn/app-development/widgets/widget-library).

In WaveMaker, apps are built on the concept called [variables](/learn/app-development/variables/variables) to connect frontend and backend. You can develop business logics using APIs, web services, java services, or write your own code to extend an original feature. Integrate it with widgets in a few clicks and use them across the project. 

In addition, WaveMaker is also a simple-to-use solution for building apps faster with one-click deployment. In this section, you can find a complete developers' guide for building apps in WaveMaker Studio.

## WaveMaker Studios
WaveMaker supports two types of Studios.  
- **WaveMaker Online** (WMO) - a cloud product. 
- **WaveMaker Enterprise** (WME) - an on-premise product. For WME installation, see [WaveMaker Enterprise Setup Guide](/learn/installation/wavemaker-enterprise-setup-guide).

## WaveMaker Online (WMO)
