To join the WaveMaker community in using GitHub and Markdown, there are specific tools and terminology to get comfortable with. Below is a step-by-step guide, adapted for contributing to the [WaveMaker Developer Docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/wavemaker/docs/). The following list outlines the main steps, but you can find more content, tools, and ideas in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en) and other forums.

## WaveMaker GitHub Repo

We have a GitHub repo you can contribute to:

* **[wavemaker/docs](https://github.com/wavemaker/docs/)**
  This repository contains the official WaveMaker Developer Documentation.

### Fork the repo to contribute

You cannot work directly on the main WaveMaker `docs` repo. To contribute:

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account. A fork is your personal copy of the repository where you can make changes freely without impacting the main documentation.
2. **Clone your fork locally** using GitHub Desktop or Git commands if you prefer terminal-based workflows.
3. Make your changes in Markdown using your preferred editor (such as Visual Studio Code or Atom).
4. Submit a **pull request (PR)** from your forked repo to the main [wavemaker/docs](https://github.com/wavemaker/docs/) repo once your edits are complete.

### Recommended tools

* **Visual Studio Code** 
* **GitHub Desktop** (to manage your repo and pull requests easily)
* **Atom** (as an alternative editor for managing Markdown files)

### Contributing

Contributions may include:

* Fixing typos or inaccuracies
* Adding examples or clarifications
* Creating new documentation for features or tools

To make a contribution:

1. Navigate to the Markdown file you want to update on [GitHub](https://github.com/wavemaker/docs/).
2. Click the **Edit** (pencil) icon.
3. Make your edits.
4. Propose the change by submitting a **pull request**.

### Requesting new content

If youâ€™re not ready to contribute directly, you can open an **Issue** on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/wavemaker/docs/issues) requesting new topics, reporting errors, or suggesting improvements.
