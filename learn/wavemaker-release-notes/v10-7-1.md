## Improvements

- Added ability to load Accordion and Pane widgets dynamically when using a live variable.
- XSS Antisamy version updated from 1.5.10 to 1.6.3.
- Updated [Runtime environment](#runtime-environment).

#### Date Picker Widget

Introduced options to:

- Choose between native and web pickers in a mobile app. Until now, it was always a native picker.
- Add a title to the header.
- Add actions to the footer.

## Bug Fixes

---

#### Date and Time Widgets

- Fixed an issue related to Datepicker, particularly when you click the label, it opens a native Datepicker twice.
- Fixed an issue related to the output format for the DateTime widget. Precisely, when you set the Datetime widget to a date format other than "timestamp," it throws a validation error for the widget in mobile devices, including the app and browser.
- Fixed an issue related to a Time widget. A random value `4:18` is set in edit mode in a Data table column, including Android mobile browsers and tablets, and iPad devices.

#### Blob type

- Fixed an issue related to not opening blob files retrieved from DB using the openFile device variable.

#### Authorization in OAuth 2.0

- Fixed an issue related to the authorization URL, specifically when the authorization URL contains extra parameters, it generates an incorrect authorized URL at runtime.

#### Inspection Framework

- Fixed an issue related to Inspect Framework throwing error when including config params in the `formatters.js` file.
- Fixed an issue related to running deployments because of the Inspection results not triggering the calls. 

#### Build and Deployment

- Fixed an issue related to permissions to access the configured `idpmetadata.xml` file via URL in the deployment mode.
- Fixed an issue related to app build failure when the build machine is in a docker container. Changed the way the `$USER_HOME` directory was being read in a node module.
- Fixed issues related to Build projects with dependencies scope attribute set as "test."
- Fixed an issue related to angular build failures in Windows OS.
