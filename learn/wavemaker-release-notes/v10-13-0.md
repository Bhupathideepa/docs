### Import WaveMaker Project using VCS URL

You can create a WaveMaker Project using a VCS providers' clone URL, allowing you to duplicate projects. Currently, supported providers include GitHub and GitLab.

### New Format Types in Use Expression

Configure rendering of HTML contents by using the **Format Type** property in **Use Expression**. 

1. You can allow to sanitize contents by choosing the **Sanitize** option allowing you to protect from XSS attacks.
2. You can choose to select **asTrust** to allow HTML contents and understand risks of XSS attacks. 

**Applies to**:  Data Table, Label, HTML, Anchor, Panel, Richtext Editor

### Data Table, HTML, Richtext Behavior

The default behavior of rendering Richtext in the Data Table had changed to rendering as plain text. Therefore, the columns display HTML tags when using Richtext data. 

#### Rendering Richtext now and before

Example-1: 

Now: `<b>text</b>`   
Before: **text**

Example-2: 

Now: `text`   
Before: text

We recommend using the Label widget to render Richtext appropriately in such cases. 

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue related to editing Prefab message key to languages other than English.
