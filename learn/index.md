*Introduction to WaveMaker and getting started with WM Studio the Low-code platform and RAD (Rapid Application Development).*

---

WaveMaker is a low-code platform for developing enterprise apps. It is a design studio with over 80 widgets that work out-of-the-box for developing a rich and modern end-to-end application. Simply drag-and-drop UI components and bind them with data and services. 

WaveMaker apps are built on the concept called variables. You can create simple to complex variables which contain data and services. You bind them with the UI in a few clicks and done. Also, you can extend your app using APIs, web services, or write your own code to extend an original feature. 

In addition, WaveMaker is also a simple-to-use solution for building apps faster with one-click deployment. In this section, you can find a complete developers' guide for building apps in WaveMaker Studio.

## WaveMaker Studios
WaveMaker supports two types of Studios.  
- **WaveMaker Online** (WMO) - a cloud product. 
- **WaveMaker Enterprise** (WME) - an on-premise product. For more information, see [Enterprise App Development](https://www.wavemaker.com/enterprise-application-development-software/).
