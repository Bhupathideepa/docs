**Form** widget provides a columnar group of input elements for user entry. A form can be bound to a web service and used to pass parameters needed to trigger the web service. They can also be bound to a database CRUD or query via Java service/Web service and used to perform CRUD operations through API calls.

Form fields are auto-generated from the service variable input parameters to which it is bound and can be configured to:

- be represented by appropriate widgets,
- enable field input validation,
- reset form field data;
- perform actions like editing and saving the form fields and adding a new record;
- different layout styles like 1-column, 2-columns or 3-columns.
