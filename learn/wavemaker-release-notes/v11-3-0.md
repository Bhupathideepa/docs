### Prefab Marketplace

WaveMaker now allows you to **Publish** Prefab to Marketplace and **Consume** Prefabs that are published by different teams. This furnishes independent software vendors to achieve productivity by enabling developers to reuse each other's code through this platform; this well enables you to explore Prefabs and discover different teams for collaboration.

#### Semantic Versioning of Artifact

By allowing Publish to Marketplace, WaveMaker enables the use of Semantic Versioning for artifact publishing. This is a globally recognized standard for publishing package models, allowing the developers to track versions for software integration and more. 

### React Native Animations and Enhancements

We bring you some facets of design elements to vivify your mobile application. Incorporate app-loading animations, skeleton loaders, and more to render at the time of loading the application. This enables developers to achieve consumer-grade applications and provide a more delightful experience for the end users. 

#### Splash Screen Animation

Add animation at the time of launching the application loading screen that enhances the app user experience. You can simply add plain color or an image too.

#### Lottie File Support for Spinners

Add Spinners for the application supported by Lottie files. The Spinner's styling is generated from the default theme or the applied theme.

#### Skeleton Loaders

Enable Skeleton layout loaders. This produces the widget's size and styles used in the app to create a skeleton of the layout when the application is loading. You can further customize the colors through code.

#### Embed React Native Apps

React native app that is built in WaveMaker, can be embedded as part of an another Native Android and iOS app.

#### Third-party Plugin Integration

WaveMaker added support for npm, git, and local in addition to Expo plugins. 

#### Custom Formatter Support

WaveMaker added support for customization of data using Custom Formatter. For more information, see [Custom Formatter](/learn/app-development/variables/custom-formatter).

### Improvements

---

#### User VCS Credentials and User Teamportal

Introduced a new section called **Access Type** when adding Code Repository in Teams Portal to manage VCS access to the team members, permitting the members to perform defined VCS operations. For more information, see [Access Type in Code Repository](/learn/teams/code-repository#access-type).

#### Logout User Sessions of Platform

You can now manage the logout sessions of the platform users for performing planned upgrades. For more information, see [Restrict Logout Sessions](/learn/on-premise/configure/config-users-auth-providers#restricting-login-for-all-users).

#### Support for JWS or Opaque Token Provider 

You can now add another layer of security to your application when accessing the WaveMaker app's API by passing a token. For this, you can enable JWS or Opaque token as a secondary provider and pass the token when the APIs are being called from another app or 3rd party app.

#### Open SAML Upgrade

Wavemaker is internally using Opensaml version 4 in SAML integration, but now you can revert the version and use Opensaml version 3. For more information, see [Reverting to Opensaml version 3](learn/app-development/app-security/saml-integration/#reverting-to-opensaml-version-3)

#### Restructuring Project Listing Page in Teamportal

Introduced two new options in Manage Projects page, Import Project from Code Repository and Export Project details, while refractoring in Teams Portal. For more information, see [Manage Projects](learn/teams/manage-projects)

#### Set Holiday Days and Dates 

WaveMaker enabled support to exclude the desired days and dates from the Date and DateTime widget in Cordova apps using Exclude Days and Exclude Dates properties. For more information, see [Date, Time and Datetime](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/date-time-datetime/)
