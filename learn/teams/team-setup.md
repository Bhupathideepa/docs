- **Name**

    A non-editable field that displays the name of the team.

- **Email Domain**

   Specifying domains in this setting prevents users from joining the team when their email domain is not on the list. Only users that have an email domain matching the defined domains may join the team.

- **Default Package prefix**

    Defines the default package for the generated code across all projects. It can be changed later for any specific project. This can be modified as per your requirements.

- The **copyright** information is generated by default which can be modified.

## Configuring VCS details

You can choose to add one or more code repositories. Teams portal is a central place to provide or edit the credentials for code repositories. These credentials will be used when developers are collaborating on applications, and pushing and pulling changes from the code repository.

For more information, see [Manage VCS](/learn/teams/code-repository).

## Team Visibility

Team helps isolate workspaces. This means resources (Projects, Deployments, Settings, Members access, Roles etc) are restricted to its workspace. A user can be part of multiple teams. One can switch between different teams he is part of and access the resources in that specific Team. In addition to team, a personal workspace is created for the user whose resources are restricted to his own workspace.

One can switch to a specific team by clicking on the **avatar** icon on top right corner, and selecting the specific team.
