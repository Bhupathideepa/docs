## What's new

- **[Working in branches](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#work-in-branches)** offers more than just tracking developers' changes. Organize branches to plan features and hotfixes simultaneously, independently. Applies to WMO Teams subscribed customers.  


- While support for branching requires enhancements to **[how VCS operates](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#vcs-enhancements)**, including how you manage projects, groups, and organizations. See how these changes your [current workflow](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#vcs-enhancements) if you are a member of WMO Teams.


- Are you already a part of the Amazon ecosystem? In that case, we have good news for you. With the **[support of the Redshift database](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#support-for-red-shift-database)** in WaveMaker, get speedy, high performance, horizontally scalable, with the ability to add massive capacity storage - all in the cloud. 


- Are you using **[SAP HANA](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#support-for-sap-hana-database)** in your SAP modules? With the introduction of SAP HANA, import the SAP HANA database into WaveMaker for seamless integration of column-based data model. It improves flexibility, performance and uses an in-memory store with the read and editable modes.

- Limitations to access public servers apply to most organizations. We understand. **[UI Artifacts](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#ui-artifacts-now-published-to-npm)** publish to the npm package manager. Incorporate UI Artifacts and simplify CI-CD pipeline using standard npm repo without worrying about firewall restrictions safely. 

- When you go grocery shopping, you know where to find the items you need. A new property called **[Groupby](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#other-improvements)** helps you group and classify data to arrange things systematically. We introduced this property within several widgets, including Select, Search, Chip, Radioset, and Autocomplete.
