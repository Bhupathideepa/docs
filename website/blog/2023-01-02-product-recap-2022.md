Since the onset of the pandemic, there has been an inevitable surge, and dependency on digitalization for faster development approaches—the flexibility to acclimate modern solutions with less complexity. 

Undoubtedly people are rapidly becoming more reliant on mobile devices and, by extension, mobile applications; this provides opportunities not only for developing new solutions but also for enhancing existing ones. Although several mobile apps are available, the demand for new ones is still on the rise due to the rapid advancement in technology and the need for more innovative approaches. 

We learned the importance of providing the native cross platform app development studio, amongst all features delivered in 2022, providing a solid backend framework of React Native support with access to open-source libraries is not just a quick fix but has a lot to offer in a long run.

Simply put, WaveMaker has worked to provide all development needs—everything put together in one place to deliver production-ready apps, mobile or web, faster and safer and with better quality. The application development and driving it to production is possible with minimum effort and time.

### Mobile Dev Studio

We released a brand new React Native studio experience for mobile app development. 

Somehow we are always circling back to cross-platform development, aren’t we? As a reminder, with cross-platform development, you can create apps that will run on different operating systems without changing the codebase too much.

But this trend is not only growing but it is blurring the lines between software for smartphones and PCs. For example, Apple has already released a chip allowing both iOS and macOS apps to run simultaneously.
