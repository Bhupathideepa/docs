​WaveMaker's Release 11.10.5 is packed with numerous bug fixes for both Web and React Native platforms. This update also features important enhancements, including titles for web routes, customizing the base path while importing REST services in Web, support for Promises in Wizard widget, and introducing an aspect ratio property for images in React Native.

---

## Enhancements

<details><summary> Displaying Title For Studio Pages </summary>

With this release, we have introduced a new option to export the project resources, **Project as Angular ZIP**. This generated zip file contains UI resources of an Angular application which can later be downloaded helping users to use the neccessary UI resources outside the studio.

</details>

<details><summary> Customizing Basepath while Importing Rest Service </summary>

In this release, we have enabled users to customize the basepath of the rest services while importing. Currently, the endpoints of the deployed services look like this,  

`cloud.wavemakeronline.com/[TEAMS_NAME]/[APPLICATION_NAME]/`

Now, when a webservice is imported, the basepath is taken as the [TEAMS_NAME] and rest of the URL, `[APPLICATION_NAME]/services/....` is the Java layer.

With this enhancement, users will be able to avoid any issues that might arise when changing the application name as the application name is hardcoded in the Java service layer.

</details>

<details><summary> Support for Promises in Wizard Widget</summary>

In the Wizard widget, users previously had to manually trigger API calls when attempting to navigate to the next step, if the **Next** callback returned false. With the current change, Promises have been integrated into the Next callback. This allows for asynchronous checks before proceeding, enabling users to skip the current step and move forward seamlessly.

</details>

### React Native

<details><summary> Aspect Ratio Property for Images </summary>

​A new property, aspectRatio, has been introduced to the Picture widget, allowing users to bypass the default natural width and height calculations. 

**Example:** By specifying an aspect ratio, users can set one dimension, such as width: 100%, and the other dimension, height, will be automatically calculated and rendered based on the provided aspect ratio.

</details>


## Bug Fixes

<details><summary>Users Unable to View Action Button and Subheading</summary>

In the Data Table widget, it was observed that the users were unable to view new action button and subheading upon binding with variable.

</details>


### React Native

<details><summary> Incorrect Order of Events getting Triggered. </summary>

An issue was observed and fixed in case of Form field where the On blur event was getting triggered before the On change event.

</details>

<details><summary> Selected Item in List Widget is Not Reflecting. </summary>

In case of List widget, the UI was not reflecting the changes upon selecting any item through Script in the list.

</details>

<details><summary> Unable to View Selected List Item in Horizontal Scroll. </summary>

When an item was selected in a horizontally scrolling List widget, the item was not visible within the viewport, because the list does not automatically scroll to bring the selected item into view. Users have to manually scroll the list to see their selection if it's off-screen.

</details>

<details><summary> Padding and Margin Issue in List Widget. </summary>

- In List widget, when applying custom padding and margin to list items, users were unable to override the default padding of 4px and the custom padding was applied on top of the default padding. 
- Additionally, applying margin to a list item was not affect the spacing between adjacent list items. Instead, the margin is applied internally, effectively increasing the padding within the list item's boundaries.

**Example**: Setting margin-right: 10px on a list item behaves like padding-right: 10px, pushing content within the item but not spacing it from the next item.

</details>

<details><summary> Unnecessary Space When Using Form Fields. </summary>

An issue was observed and fixed in iOS applications where the users noticed extra spacing under the input form field when entering any text. This was noticed in the Form widget.

</details>

<details><summary> Splash Screen and App Icon Updates were Not Reflected in **app.json** File. </summary>

When updating the Splash Screen or app Icon through the studio interface and running a preview, the corresponding paths in the generated-rn-app's app.json file are not updated. Instead, the app.json continues to reference the default WaveMaker icons. The changes only take effect after manually updating the paths in the app.json file located in the generated-rn-app directory.

</details>

<details><summary> Swipe Up and Swipe Down Events were Not Working. </summary>

An issue was observed where users were unable to swipe up and swipe down page content by applying swipe up and swipe down events. This issue is now fixed.

</details>

<details><summary> Unable to Submit Date and Datetime Form Field Type. </summary>

In case of Live Form and Form widgets, where Form field type was set as date or datetime, users were unable to submit the Form.

</details>

<details><summary> Tabs Widget Crash Issue. </summary>

In Android applications, an issue was observed where the Tabs widget was crashing when the show property of tab panes were bound to a conditional class for determining the visibility of tab panes.

</details>

<details><summary> WebView Clickability is Not Working within Tabs Widget. </summary>

The WebView widget functions correctly (is clickable) when placed in the first tab of the Tabs widget. But from the second tab onwards, the WebView widget becomes non-clickable, rendering its content unresponsive to user interaction.

</details>
