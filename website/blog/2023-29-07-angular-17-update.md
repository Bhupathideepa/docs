**List widgets**: All widgets within a List.
**Nested Lists**: Lists within Lists.
**Form widgets**: All widgets within a Form.
**Nested Forms**: Forms within Forms.
**Action buttons**: Buttons in Tables, Forms, and Filters.
**Navigation (Nav) widget**: Menu and navigation elements.
**Carousel, Tabs, and Accordion**: Both static and dynamic versions.
**Select and Search widgets**: Dropdown and search boxes.
**Mobile-specific widgets**: Media-list and Navbar.

By thoroughly testing these components, you can ensure a smooth transition to Angular 17.
