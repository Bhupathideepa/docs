One can also build apk or ipa on their system from a react-native zip. To help the WaveMaker developers in this manual process, ```wm-reactnative-cli``` is created. ```wm-reactnative-cli``` combines multiple react-native commands into a single command. Please follow the below procedure.

1. Go through the documentation of wm-reactnative-cli. [https://github.com/wavemaker/wm-reactnative-cli](https://github.com/wavemaker/wm-reactnative-cli)
2. Make sure that all the hardware and software required by wm-reactnative-cli are present.
3. As explained below, export and download the react-native zip from WaveMaker studio.
4. Execute wm-react-native command with respective arguments based upon platform (Android or iOS).
5. wm-reactnative-cli will log the destination build folder at the begining. When the build gets completed, wm-reactnative-cli prints out the path at which the built artifact is present.
