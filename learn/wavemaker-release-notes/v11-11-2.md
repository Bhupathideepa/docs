## Enhancements

### Web

<details><summary>Option To Set Date Pattern Through Value Expression</summary>

Previously, the Date widget did not support dynamic binding for the Date Pattern property — it could only be set using a static value. This limitation restricted users from implementing more flexible scenarios. Dynamic binding for the Date Pattern property is now supported.

## Bug Fixes

### Web

<details><summary>Unable to View Date Picker in Calendar Widget</summary>

In case of Datetime widget, user reported that the date picker is going off-screen when trying to select a date, making it difficult to scroll through months or years.

</details>

<details><summary>Custom Icons Not Getting Applied</summary>

When binding custom Icons to any widget, custom icons are not getting applied to the application.

</details>

<details><summary>Accessibility Issue in Data Table</summary>

Resolved an issue where pressing Enter while tabbing through the table was incorrectly toggling checkboxes, even when the checkbox field was not focused.

</details>

<details><summary>Wizard Widget Validation Handling Issue</summary>

An issue has been observed when adding wizard validation based on an API response—the wizard proceeds to the next step even if the API response or validation fails. This issue was only noticed during deployment.

</details>

### React Native

<details><summary>Users unable to switch tabs in Tabs widget.</summary>

On the initial navigation to a page containing the Tabs widget, users occasionally experienced issues when attempting to switch between tabs. This issue has been resolved, and tab switching now works as expected.
