App Logo is used in multiple places like:

- the header of each page
- the login page

[![design_logo](../assets/design_logo.png)](../assets/design_logo.png) By default WaveMaker logo is used as app logo. You can change it by replaging the logo file:

1. the Main Menu, under  **-> Resource** option locate the  the images folder. [![design_logo_resource](../assets/design_logo_resource.png)](../assets/design_logo_resource.png)
2. this file and upload the icon of your choice at the **location with the same name**
3. the app and see the change
