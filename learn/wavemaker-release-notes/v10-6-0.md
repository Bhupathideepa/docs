## New Features

---

### AppChef

WaveMaker is creating mobile app build service that is fully integrated with WaveMaker studio. It will be released in the near future. Meanwhile, to help WaveMaker developers, WaveMaker is releasing a service called AppChef (Similar to PhoneGap). This AppChef internally uses [wm-cordova-cli](/learn/hybrid-mobile/mobile-build-manual). To build apk or ipa, a developer has to export cordova zip from the studio and upload it to AppChef. [Click here](/learn/hybrid-mobile/mobile-build-appchef) to know 'How to use AppChef'. 

### Page Cache

A new flag called 'Cache' is introduced on the Page tag. Using this flag, one can specify whether to use a cached page on re-visit. Using a cached page, significantly improves render performance. By default, this flag is turned off. [Click here](/learn/app-development/ui-design/page-concepts/page-cache) to know more about this 'Cache' flag.

### Session Persistence Horizontal Scaling

As your application demand raises, the user-base will increase and therefore it requires you to handle large number of requests, in such cases, you will need to plan how to scale your application to support the huge demand. To learn more, see [Session Persistence](/learn/app-development/session-persistence)


### Retain State


### PKCE


### Tablet View


## Improvements

---

- You can include the version number in the filename of the exported Cordova zip.
- Included an `itemsperrow` property for the Checkboxset and Radioset widgets.
- Required a Warning message for the filter option in the Data Table if bound to query or procedure variable "This will filter the data in each page of the Data Table widget instead of complete data table data set".

### Mobile

- Upgraded to Cordova@10.0.0 and Cordova-ios@6.1.0. [Click here for more details](/learn/blog/2020/11/26/cordova-10.0.0-upgrade).
- Added the purpose of each iOS icon in the **Export Cordova zip** dialog.
- Till now, apps created in WaveMaker support both iPhone and iPad by default. There was no control to specify this preference to support only iPhone. In this release, a new preference called 'Target Device' is added under iOS preferences in the **Export Cordova zip** dialog. Using this preference, you can specify whether app supports iPhone or both iPhone and iPad. For old projects, this option is set as 'iPhone and iPad'. For new projects, this option is set as 'iPhone'.
