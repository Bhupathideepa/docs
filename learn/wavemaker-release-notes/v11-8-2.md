## React Native Enhancement

**CSS Style Class in Chart Widget**

New CSS style classes have been added to all the chart types to customize the title, subtitle, icon, and center label. The classes added to the charts are,

- Area Chart
  - .app-area-chart-title
  - .app-area-chart-subtitle
  - .app-area-chart-icon
- Bar Chart
  - .app-bar-chart-title
  - .app-bar-chart-subtitle
  - .app-bar-chart-icon
- Bubble Chart
  - .app-bubble-chart-title
  - .app-bubble-chart-subtitle
  - .app-bubble-chart-icon
- Column Chart
  - .app-column-chart-title
  - .app-column-chart-subtitle.
  - .app-column-chart-icon
- Donut Chart
  - .app-donut-chart-title
  - .app-donut-chart-subtitle
  - .app-donut-chart-icon
  - .app-donut-chart-centerlabel
- Line Chart
  - .app-line-chart-title
  - .app-line-chart-subtitle
  - .app-line-chart-icon
- Pie Chart
  - .app-pie-chart-title
  - .app-pie-chart-subtitle
  - .app-pie-chart-icon


:::impact
Previously, the Chart widget did not render the title, subtitle, icon, or center label values. With this enhancement, if the user does not set these values using the specified class, the widget will now apply default title, subtitle, icon, and center label values.

## Bug Fixes

### FileUpload Widget

We are providing default file extensions allowed for upload, based on the Whitelist approach to prohibit security vulnerabilities. These extensions are configured at application level in **Allowed File Upload Extensions** under General Settings. The allowed list of extensions is:
- doc
- docx
- xls
- xlsx
- csv
- pdf
- txt
- image/*

![Allowed File Upload Extensions](/learn/assets/allowed-file-upload-extensions.png)

- `*/*` can be used to accept file of any extension and avoid all the restrictions.

When extensions are specified in the FileUpload widget, only files with those extensions will be allowed for upload; otherwise, the widget will accept the extensions configured at the application level.

:::impact
For existing applications, users need to specify the allowed extensions to prevent upload failures. By default, if no extensions are provided in the FileUpload widget, it will accept the extensions defined by the whitelisting approach.

### Textarea Widget

An issue was observed with the Textarea widget when binding the default value from the Property panel. On initial load, the character length is displayed as zero, but the correct character length is shown when the value is entered directly into the text area.

### Page Params

When navigating from one page to another that contains page params, user was unable to see the page params in preview. This occured when the menu button in the left nav was clicked where it only displayed the menu items in the left nav but did not display the page params.

**Before Fix**

**After Fix**

### Offset Server Side Pagination

Users can specify the offset and limit values in the request header. Previously, the offset value would default to the second page whenever the API was reinvoked. This issue has been resolved by setting the offset value to zero, ensuring to land on the first page.

## React Native Fixes

### Show Property

The **Show** property is used to show or hide any widget. Earlier, the widget with show property was hidden if the show property value was either zero or false but it was displayed if it was empty string. To fix this issue, an additional condition is added that checks if the show property is bound to an empty string.

### Currency Widget

Now, only numeric values are allowed in the Currency widget which earlier allowed both numeric and non-numeric values. Also added validations to the **decimalPlaces** property where only the provided number of decimal places will be accepted where earlier the user was able to enter more than the provided number of decimal places.

### Enable Ripple Effect

After the introduction of Material 3 design, the ripple effect was enabled by default whenever the user tapped on a component. This fix allows the user to enable or disable the ripple effect by setting the **enableRipple** property as true or false respectively.

The Ripple effect is applicable to the components with the **On Tap** Touch event. The tappable components are,
- Anchor
- Label
- Carousel
- Button
- Icon
- Picture
- Progress Bar
- Progress Circle
- Search
- Container
- Tile
- Card
- List
- Select
- Switch

### Wizard Widget

In the Wizard widget where multiple steps contain different content in each step, a default step can be selected. The content in the default step gets rendered when the wizard loads for the first time.

If the default step is not selected the first step gets displayed by default.

### Web Preview Debugger

Observed an issue when user tried to preview an application and added a break point in the source code. This action froze the console screen briefly.

### Column Chart Widget

User was facing an error where the **`chartWidth`** property of the undefined data type was not recognised. This was crashing the page with Column Chart widget while previewing the application on emulator.
