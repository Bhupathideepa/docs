---

​WaveMaker's Release 11.10.4 is packed with numerous bug fixes for both Web and React Native platforms. This update also features important enhancements, including titles for web routes, customizing the base path while importing REST services in Web, support for Promises in Wizard widget, and introducing an aspect ratio property for images in React Native.

---

## Enhancements

<details><summary> Displaying Title For Studio Pages </summary>

Introducing titles for studio pages enhances user experience by displaying meaningful page titles in the browser's tab. Now, when users navigate to a specific page, database, Java service, or any other route, the title updates accordingly to reflect the route name with the **Page name**, instead of displaying the generic title like **WaveMaker studio**. This improvement provides a more user-friendly and intuitive experience during page navigation.

**After:**

</details>

<details><summary> Customizing Basepath while Importing Rest Service </summary>

In this release, we have enabled users to customize the basepath of the rest services while importing. Currently, the endpoints of the deployed services look like this,  

`cloud.wavemakeronline.com/[TEAMS_NAME]/[APPLICATION_NAME]/`

Now, when a webservice is imported, the basepath is taken as the [TEAMS_NAME] and rest of the URL, `[APPLICATION_NAME]/services/....` is the Java layer.

With this enhancement, users will be able to avoid any issues that might arise when changing the application name as the application name is hardcoded in the Java service layer.

</details>

<details><summary> Support for Promises in Wizard Widget</summary>

In the Wizard widget, users previously had to manually trigger API calls when attempting to navigate to the next step, if the **Next** callback returned false. With the current change, Promises have been integrated into the Next callback. This allows for asynchronous checks before proceeding, enabling users to skip the current step and move forward seamlessly.

</details>

### React Native

<details><summary> Aspect Ratio Property for Images </summary>

​A new property, aspectRatio, has been introduced to the Picture widget, allowing users to bypass the default natural width and height calculations. 

**Example:** By specifying an aspect ratio, users can set one dimension, such as width: 100%, and the other dimension, height, will be automatically calculated and rendered based on the provided aspect ratio.

</details>


## Bug Fixes

<details><summary>Users Unable to View Action Button and Subheading</summary>

In the Data Table widget, it was observed that the users were unable to view new action button and subheading upon binding with variable.

In case of Opaque security provider, users were unable to view the configurations in the Security settings tab when the details were added in the **authinfo.json** file.

</details>

<details><summary> Unable to View Total Record Count in Single Page </summary>

Previously, users could view the total record count only when multiple pages existed and the **Show Total Records option** was enabled. Now, with the **Show Total Records** option enabled, users can view the total record count even when there is a single page.

</details>

<details><summary> Adding Step Issue in Wizard Widget </summary>

Users encountered an issue when adding a new step in the Wizard widget. Due to this issue, in the Markup tab, the new step appeared after the wizard action.

</details>

<details><summary> Incorrect Date Format in Datetime Widget</summary>

In the Datetime widget, the Date constructor does not support certain formats like dd/mm/yyyy. As a result, when the user provided input in the dd/mm/yyyy format, JavaScript interpreted it as mm/dd/yyyy, leading to incorrect dates.

</details>

<details><summary> Duplicate Name Issue in Custom Icons </summary>

An issue was observed and fixed in case of Custom icons, where users were able to use the same name for multiple custom icons that were imported.

</details>


<details><summary> Error Message Issue during Database Reimport </summary>

An issue was observed and fixed during the reimporting of the database, where users saw the error message **[object Object]** instead of the actual error that had occurred.

**Before Fix:**

</details>

</details>

</details>

<details><summary>Search Widget Icon Customization Issues</summary>

In the Search widget, users encountered the following issues while customizing icons for both the clear and search functionalities:

- The widget continued to display the default icon when attempting to replace the default clear icon with a custom one.
- When updating the search icon, the change was correctly reflected in Design; however, the widget's preview still displayed the default search icon, ignoring the customization.

</details>

<details><summary> Third Party Plugins resulting Build Failure </summary>

- `react-native-haptic-feedback`

</details>

</details>

<details><summary> Horizontal scroll height to be changed for List Widget</summary>

</details>


<details><summary> Layout Issues Caused by ScrollToPosition Function </summary>

Resolved all the layout issues that occurred due to Autoscrolling feature's `scrollToPosition` Function.

</details>

<details><summary> Unwanted Skeleton Loader on Page Transitions </summary>

The user noticed that Skeleton Loader appeared when navigating between pages in app, even when it’s not needed. To fix this issue, users need to add the following in the Markup section.

```xml
<wm-content showskeleton="false" name="content1" backgroundcolor="#ffffff">        
<wm-left-panel content="leftnav" name="left_panel1"></wm-left-panel>        
<wm-page-content columnwidth="12" name="page_content1" backgroundcolor="#ffffff">            
<wm-label padding="unset" name="label1"></wm-label>            
<wm-label padding="unset" name="label2"></wm-label>            
<wm-label padding="unset" name="label3"></wm-label>            
<wm-label padding="unset" name="label4"></wm-label>        
</wm-page-content>    
</wm-content>

```

:::note

Ensure to set **showskeleton** to false in  `wm-content` tag with no alterations to the Markup code. It is also necessary to use the **`wm-content`** tag as parent of **`wm-page-content`**.

:::

</details>

<details><summary> showDefaultVideoPoster for Video Widget </summary>

​In Expo SDK 52, the Video widget required a video thumbnail; without it, the widget would malfunction. To address this issue, a new property, **showDefaultVideoPoster**, has been introduced. By setting this property to false in the Markup section, developers can prevent the widget from using a default thumbnail.

```xml
<WMVideo showdefaultvideoposter="false"/>
```

</details>
