*WaveMaker released a new update version with bug fixes.*

## Bug fixes

---

### Widgets

#### Data Table
- For Data table with Live form, when you specify a date pattern that is not present in the dropdown, a validation error is thrown.
- For a Data table configured with inline edit and with no row actions, there was no actionable to click on while creating new row. This is now fixed.
- If a Data table or Form widget is configured with Imported swagger's CRUD variable then in Form widget advanced settings dialog duplicate fields are shown.

#### Carousel
- Carousel is not shown when height of the widget set to "%" during preview

#### Checkboxset
- Checkboxset checked values don't stay checked after resetting the datavalue from JS

#### List
- In List Widget "No Data Found" message is pushed to the bottom when a height is set.

#### File Upload
- For file upload widget, drag and drop option for multiple files are now enabled in WM 10. Messages are localized.

#### Switch
- Datavalues are changing when clicked on the widget even if it is disabled.

#### Popover
- Issues with popover positioning in different scenarios.

### Notification Action
- onOk of one confirm action if another confirm action is invoked then the 2nd confirm action is not getting opened

### REST services

- Fixed an issue of out of memory error when you test a REST service with a large response body.
- When Open ID fails while fetching the token we are not observing any logs.

### Localization

- **Time Widget**: For localization, when time widget format is set to 12 hr then entered time value is shown as invalid in some languages. This is fixed.
- **Date/Time display formats**: On changing locale, in preview mode selected date/time values show up in English format but in deployment(angular prod) values show up in selected language format. This is fixed.

### Trial Users

- Unable to open starter apps in WaveMaker Studio.
- When you try to deploy the app, you see deploy dialog and then the error dialog.

### Mobile

- Invoking PUT calls from mobile device throws an Invalid CORS request error. This is fixed.

---

- Intermittent Navigation from one page to another page is not working for applications deployed in angular prod profile. This is now fixed.
- Change id to the pkId field name for the api that is used for fetching child objects for consistency
- JsessionId cookie is being set when we hit the APIs with Token/Basic authorization
- Server side property "LoggedIn UserId" is always inserting user name instead of the id, this occurs when we hit the APIs with token based authorization and when the loggedIn userid is string.
- Unable to get the actual cause of failure of authentication for OpenId provider
- Build About info popup is not shown in "Manage Deployed apps" portal and "Account/Subscription" portal
- User is not navigated to redirect page after login in angular build
- Deployment to Digital Ocean cluster is failing if the application name has special characters in it.
- when page rename occurs update DataBindings if target is pageName
- In the Manage Deployed Apps section, the last updated dates of the logs doesn't match with the date inside the log files
