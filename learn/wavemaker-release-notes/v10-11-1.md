### Data Table

- Fixed an issue related to the multicolumn filter in Data Table for sorting dates that are not aligned correctly for Default Theme.
- Fixed an issue related to setting the width of the columns in the advance settings of a Data Table; the table in the inactive tab does not load with the column width as defined.
- Fixed an issue related to the column field of Data Table. When no column is selected in the table search filter, it should search the table data for the displayed columns.
- Fixed an issue related to the Dirty property in Live Form, displaying `true` even when you do not make any changes in the Liveform preview.
