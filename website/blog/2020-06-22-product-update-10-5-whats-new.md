Let's jump straight to see what's new in this release!

## Deploy to CDN

***Well, speed matters!***

Ensuring a consistent user experience is important not just in terms of features and looks, but also in terms of speed. With our 10.5 update, we are all set to adapt CDN into WaveMaker. All you have to do is nothing different than before - thanks to our backend team! Now you can deploy your apps with CDN automatically with improved performance. To read our developer blog, see [delivering your apps faster with WaveMaker](/learn/blog/2020/06/23/deliver-faster-applications-with-wavemaker).

## Extended Micro-frontend Support

***Smaller apps are easy to develop, maintain and communicate with each other!***

In the last update 10.4, we introduced support for building Micro-frontend applications. This architecture encourages the independent delivery of frontend applications with a Node-based CLI. A CLI helps to convert **[WaveMaker](https://www.wavemakeronline.com/login/login)** apps to **[Single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/)** compatible app. In this release, we updated the version to 3.4 of `single-spa-angular` for better support of Angular 7 projects.

## Data Table Summary Row

***If Data Table is your widget, this is for you!***

A table is considered as the most preferred method to represent data that talk! And having to do more with the Data Table adds so much value to it. And we are thrilled to add a summary row function, which helps you to add functions in your Data Table. For example, sum, average, and more. To learn how it works, check out the [Data Table Summary Row documentation](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/datatable/summary-row).

Well, that's not it.

Despite all that's happening around the world, the lockdown had almost no impact on how we deliver our product updates. And, this wouldn't have been possible without our teams' brilliant work!
