[Theme builder](https://apps.wavemakeronline.com/Theme_Builder/#/Dashboard) app has introduced a new feature of recognising any website's color palette and using the discovered colors in the WaveMaker theme. This new feature will make building a WaveMaker theme easier by making the choices for color, font etc from your existing website. You can further view and design the WM components based on the colors and download the theme. 

With the recent release, we have also fixed a few bugs. Know more....
