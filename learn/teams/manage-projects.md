One of the main features of **Team** is the ability to share projects and collaborate on them with other users. Sharing a project with team member is more powerful, as the only users who will be allowed to access the project are users who you have invited to collaborate on the project. You can even choose to restrict what type of access other users have to specific projects.

You can access the Manage Projects page in the administration area by clicking on the **Manage Projects** entry in the left panel.

-  Remove a user from project
