Teams are groups of organization members that reflect your organization and organize your group’s work. On a team's page, you can 

Simplify Access Management - Make anyone a Team admin. Or don’t. The power is yours. Need to add someone to your team? No problem. Search by email address or add anybody by email address, whether they have a WaveMaker account or not. Those new to WaveMaker will receive an invite and get automatically added to your Team.

Collaborate seamlessly - Sharing projects with your team is effortless. Add/Remove members to/from projects.

Code Repository - Add multiple team-owned code repositories where the project's source code will reside.

Role Management - Set up roles to quickly organize members and their privilege levels.

Team profile - Team admin can access team settings and update the team's profile.

Priced Right for Small Teams - We have restructured our pricing to introduce a new Team Subscription plan.
