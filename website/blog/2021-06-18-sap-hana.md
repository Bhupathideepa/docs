SAP HANA Cloud is a fully managed in-memory and column based cloud database as a service (DBaaS) offered by SAP that helps in managing your data storage and integration while running powerful applications.

In SAP HANA the data is completely stored in main memory and when the main memory limit is reached, the whole database objects (table, view,etc.) that are not used will be unloaded from the main memory and saved into the disk. In a Column store table, Data is stored vertically. So, similar data types come together which provides faster memory read and write operations with help of In-Memory Computing Engine.

### SAP HANA in WaveMaker

Tried importing SAP HANA database as other type in WaveMaker which is only in read mode? WaveMaker has now added support for importing SAP HANA database in both read and editable modes and create variables which can be further used to create list, data tables and other widgets.
SAP HANA database can be now imported from the “Connect to a DB” option in the databases menu.
WaveMaker takes care of adding the driver dependency in pom.xml.
For example, consider an employee table that is imported in the project.

The above table can be used to create list, data table widgets etc and perform CRUD operations on it.
Drag and drop the list widget and configure the list widget by selecting the employee table.

After configuring the widget then the user can preview the application and view the table data as a list.

The user can also create new tables, modify existing tables from the database designer instead of using the SAP HANA console if it is imported in editable mode in WaveMaker.
