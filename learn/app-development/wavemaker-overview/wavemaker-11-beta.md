We are back with a new release, and we can't wait to share all the great features and updates waiting for you in WaveMaker 11 beta. 

WaveMaker consists of a three-layer architecture for developing apps with great flexibility to customize and reuse components and services at its core while taking advantage of many new open-standard integrations that we bring along with major releases. Let's see what we got this year.


WaveMaker 11 beta release features significant advancements shaping up to impact the low-code development in a big way, especially for mobile consumers this time, and also providing an extensive range of tooling capabilities for developers, keeping the low code roots in mind and staying up-to-date with the tech demands. 

## Introducing React Native in WaveMaker

We introduce React Native, a new medium for developing native apps, including iOS and Android app development in WaveMaker Studio. This inclusion comes with almost no learning curve involved for WaveMaker developers. React Native offers platform-specific versions of components so a single codebase can share code across Android and iOS stores. [Read more](/learn/react-native/react-native).

### No, we do not deprecate Cordova.

Although our emphasis at this point is to prioritize React Native, even so, we do not plan to deprecate Cordova anytime sooner. We will continue to support Cordova app development and provide an up-to-date tech stack whenever a new update is available. 

## New Widgets in Studio

We continue to invest in producing rich studio tools that enable you to design great-looking apps using our new Linear and Flex widgets. These widgets allow you to display data in list format, giving developers complete control of vertical and horizontal layout adjustments. This feature is exclusive to React Native users for now.  


## API Composer Toolkit

Play around with multiple API endpoints to create an object and plug it as a variable.

## API Mock Server

Simulate a backend API with close-to-accurate responses for developing the UI.

## Java 11: Brings breaking changes

Java 11 version brings along a few break changes and version bumps. For this reason, we introduced parallel versioning of Studio so you can test your application while you upgrade to WaveMaker 11 beta.
