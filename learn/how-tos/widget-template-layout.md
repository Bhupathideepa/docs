Apply template/layout for widget, including List, Card and Wizard widgets.

This feature is used to change the template/layout of the widget. Here we are identifying some of the most used templates/layouts for a widget and giving an option to choose them upfront.

Here we have two types.

### Widget Template
Arrangement of inner elements

### Widget Layout
Arrangement of the outer shell

## Choosing Widget Template from Canvas

1. Drag and drop a List Widget, and [bind the widget](/learn/app-development/variables/variable-binding#binding-to-widgets) to a dataSet.

2. When you select the **List** widget on the canvas, you can see the template icon on the toolbar. Click the **template** icon.
