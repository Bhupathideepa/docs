## Enterprise Marketplace

Enterprise Marketplace lets you use published artifacts across multiple teams to reduce efforts to create an available artifact and improve collaboration. You create artifacts and team admin publishes the required version of artifact to Marketplace via Teamportal.

## Semantic Versioning

WaveMaker supports versioning system to name the releases. Semantic versioning is a univerally accepted approach, and allows you to track version compatibility. With WaveMaker 11.3, the support extends to follow semantic versioning for Artifacts, including Prefabs.

An example of semantic versioning is as shown below.
