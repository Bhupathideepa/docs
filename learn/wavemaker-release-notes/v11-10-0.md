## Features

<details><summary> Migration Report for Application Migration </summary>

With the 11.10 release, we are introducing a Migration Report that provides a summary of migration details. WaveMaker Studio introduces new features with every release, and the Studio is automatically upgraded to the latest version.

The Migration Report, presented as a markdown file, helps users understand the modifications made to their projects during the migration process.

</details>

<details><summary> Prefab as Web Component </summary>

With this release, we are taking modular development to the next level by enabling Prefabs to be exposed as web components. This enhancement allows user to build reusable components once in WaveMaker and use them across various UI frameworks, including React, Vue.js, and more. Prefabs are no longer limited to WaveMaker applications; they are now truly universal, empowering developers to seamlessly integrate them into their preferred tech stack.

## Upgrades

<details><summary> Angular 18 Upgrade </summary>

WaveMaker Studio v11.10 will upgrade all generated web applications to Angular 18 and Node v22 to ensure enhanced performance, advanced features, and long-term support. This proactive transition addresses the end-of-life of Angular 17 (May 15, 2025) and provides faster rendering, improved runtime efficiency, and better compatibility with modern libraries.

WaveMaker Studio will seamlessly manage the upgrade, preserving existing projects and providing migration reports to keep users informed. To prepare, update your build environment and CI/CD pipelines to Node 22.11.0.

To know more, see [Keeping You Ahead: WaveMaker Upgrades to Angular v18 and Node v22](/learn/blog/2025/01/06/angular-node-upgrades).

:::note
The Node upgrade applies only to Web applications, while React Native applications will continue using Node version 18.

</details>

<details><summary> Missing **package-lock.json** File </summary>

When exporting the project as React Native Zip, the **package-lock.json** file was missing. Due to this issue, users were unable to preview the application because of the missing dependency libraries.
This issue can be fixed by using any one of the following ways. 

- Run the `wm-reactnative prepare` command instead of directly running `npm install` in the zip file. The `prepare` command will give a path to react native project with installed dependencies. 
- Alternatively, users can run `yarn install` instead of `npm install`.
