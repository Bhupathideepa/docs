The **Manage Users** page lets you view and manage all users in your team. To add a new member to your team, search by email address or add members by entering the email address, whether they have a WaveMaker account or not. Those new to WaveMaker will receive an invite and get automatically added to your Team.

You can access the **Manage Users** page in the administration area by clicking the **Manage Users** entry from the left panel.

From the user list, you can

- Create a user or add an existing user
- View or edit a user’s role  
- Block a user, to prevent users from logging in to your team
- Delete a user  

## Creating Users

## Block a User

Block a user account to limit or remove access to the team resources. When you block a user account, the account status moves from **Active** to **Blocked**. The blocked users can no longer have access to their accounts. When you unblock a previously blocked user account, the user will be able to access the resources which the user earlier had access to. If you're not sure of removing the user from Team and associated resources, you can **block** the user from accessing the account.

You can block or unblock a user by using the **Block/Unblock** icon located on each row in the table as shown in the image below.

## Remove or Delete a User

Deleting an account cannot be undone. After deleting an account, the user does not show on the **Users** page and would be removed from the resources which they were associated with. When you again add a previously-deleted user account, you'll need to reassign the resources to the user.

You can delete a user by using the **Delete** icon located on each row in the table.
