The addition of a quick search functionality further enhances the user experience, enabling users to swiftly locate relevant content. Users can find relevant information by searching keywords or phrases. This can enhance the efficiency of locating specific content within the documentation.


### Enriched content and structured classification

The new documentation website provides a [structured classification](/learn/documentation-reference) of WaveMaker's **product features** and **extensions**, making it easier for users to navigate and find the information they need to help users understand and utilize WaveMaker's products effectively.
