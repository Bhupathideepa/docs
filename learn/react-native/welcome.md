React Native is a mobile app framework from Facebook. It is based on ReactJS priniciples (Virtual DOM). Developers define app UI using the React Native markup (and extensions) in JavaScript. In runtime, based on this UI definition, React Native will render UI using native UI controls similar to native apps.

In mobile devices, Cordova apps displays HTML based UI using a browser component. Developers can use HTML, CSS along with JavaScript in Cordova apps. React native apps will run JavaScript in JavaScript runtime (jsc and hermes). React Native bridge manipulates native UI based on the response (Virtual DOM) from JavaScript. CSS and HTML cannot be used in React Native apps. Markup (jsx), styles, and logic have to be defined in JavaScript for React Native apps.
