- Area Chart
  - .app-area-chart-title
  - .app-area-chart-subtitle
  - .app-area-chart-icon
- Bar Chart
  - .app-bar-chart-title
  - .app-bar-chart-subtitle
  - .app-bar-chart-icon
- Bubble Chart
  - .app-bubble-chart-title
  - .app-bubble-chart-subtitle
  - .app-bubble-chart-icon
- Column Chart
  - .app-column-chart-title
  - .app-column-chart-subtitle.
  - .app-column-chart-icon
- Donut Chart
  - .app-donut-chart-title
  - .app-donut-chart-subtitle
  - .app-donut-chart-icon
  - .app-donut-chart-centerlabel
- Line Chart
  - .app-line-chart-title
  - .app-line-chart-subtitle
  - .app-line-chart-icon
- Pie Chart
  - .app-pie-chart-title
  - .app-pie-chart-subtitle
  - .app-pie-chart-icon


:::impact
Earlier, the application with the Chart widget would not render title, subtitle, icon, and center label values for the above components. After this enhancement, if the user doesn't set the title, subtitle, icon, and center label values, in the Chart widget using the given class then the default title, subtitle, icon, and center label values get applied.

## Bug Fixes

### Text Area Widget

Observed an issue when user binds the default value available in the Property panel to Text Area widget. The character length is shown as zero during the intial load but shows the character length when value is directly entered in the text area.

### Page Params

While navigating from one page to another that contains page params, user was unable to see the page params in preview. This occured when the menu button in the left nav was clicked where it only displayed the menu items in the left nav but did not display the page params.

## React Native Fixes

### Show Property

The **Show** property is used to show or hide any widget. Earlier, the widget with show property was hidden if the show property value was either zero or false but it was displayed if it was empty string. To fix this issue, an additional condition is added that checks if the show property is bound to an empty string.

### Currency Widget

Now, only numeric values are allowed in the Currency widget which earlier allowed both numeric and non-numeric values. Also added validations to the **decimalPlaces** property where only the provided number of decimal places will be accepted where earlier the user was able to enter more than the provided number of decimal places.

### Min and Max Date Input

Earlier, the minimum and maximum date fields in the property panel used to accept only the current date value. With this fix, the user can now set the minimum and maximum date values not only as current date but any date provided in ISO format.

:::note
This fix is applicable to Date and Datetime widgets.

### Enable Ripple Effect

After the introduction of Material 3 design, the ripple effect was enabled by default whenever the user tapped on a component. This fix allows the user to enable or disable the ripple effect by setting the **enableRipple** property as true or false respectively.

The Ripple effect is applicable to the components with the **On Tap** Touch event. The tappable components are,
- Anchor
- Label
- Carousel
- Button
- Icon
- Picture
- Progress Bar
- Progress Circle
- Search
- Container
- Tile
- Card
- List
- Select
- Switch

### Wizard Widget

In the Wizard widget where multiple steps contain different content in each step, a default step can be selected. The content in the default step gets rendered when the wizard loads for the first time.

If the default step is not selected the first step gets displayed by default.
