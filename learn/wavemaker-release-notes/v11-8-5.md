## Enhancements

<details> <summary>Skeleton Loader Improvements</summary>

With the recent improvements, user can apply Skeleton Loader not only by using WaveMaker default configuration, but also using Lottie animation. Lottie animation can be used in the cases where the Page, Prefab, and Partial contain components that do not support WaveMaker default configuration to apply Skeleton Loader.

Other improvements in Skeleton Loader are listed below.

- Users can now hide or show the child components available inside a container widget by using `showskeletonchildren` property. When `showskeletonchildren` property is set to true, Skeleton Loader is applied to the child components and are displayed. When it is set to false, only the parent container widget is displayed like a card component and the child components gets hidden.
- Page, Prefab, Partials, and Charts can now get the Skeleton Loader applied using the Lottie animation. This can also be used in the cases where the users want custom Skeleton Loader to be displayed for the components. To implement this, user can add a custom JSON animation file as resource using `skeletonanimationresource="PATH_TO_JSON_RESOURCE"`. For furtherconfiguration like animation speed, users can use `skeletonanimationspeed="SPEED_REQUIRED"`.
- In List widget, users can now provide the number of widgets to be displayed in skeleton mode by using the `numberofskeletonitems` property. The value of this property is set to 3 by default.

## Bug Fixes

<details><summary>Newer Commits are not Displayed</summary>

In a Git project, the user was unable to view the newer projects in the Commit History screen as the navigation buttons were disabled. This was observed when the user had navigated to the older commits screen and later wanted to navigate to newer commits screen.

</details>
<details><summary>On Before Filter Event is not displayed in Datatable </summary>

In Datatable widget, an issue was observed where the On Before Event was not displayed in the events panel even when the **Filter Mode** in the Advanced Settings dialog is not selected as No Filter.

</details>
<details><summary>Theme Updates Dialog without Latest Version</summary>

Previously, we displayed the Updates Dialog with the Theme even when there was no latest version with any changes. Now, without any latest version, the theme will not be displayed for updates.

</details>
<details><summary>Error is Checkbox Selection in Nested Datatable</summary>

An issue was observed when Checkbox was added to the Datatable used within another Datatable. The child Datatable used within the Datatable is a Partial and can be reused in other Datatables. In such cases, the checkboxes selected in the first child Datatable were automatically selected in other Datatables.  

</details>


## React Native Fixes

<details><summary>Steps are not displayed in Wizard Widget</summary>

In Wizard widget, initially the steps are not displayed in the header when the default step is selected as None. The user was only able to view to view the contents and the steps in the header after navigating to any step. Now, all the steps with numbers will be rendered even if the default step is set as None.

</details>

<details><summary>File Upload Restrictions</summary>

Earlier, users were able to upload image, audio, video, and files with any extension which can raise security vulnerabilities. To handle this issue further restrictions were applied where only the below listed file formats will be allowed to upload.
