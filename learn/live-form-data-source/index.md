first step in configuring a Live FormÂ is to define the data that needs to be displayed. This data can be in the form of a Variable or another Widget.

### Source

binding will allow you to

- - CRUD operations on a database through Database CRUD Variables,

can either create a new variable or use existing variables. The behavior of data displayed will be defined by the Variable/Data Configuration properties. These properties are at the Variable level, you can configure them only when creating a new variable, for existing variables the properties set at the time of variable creation will be used. To modify these, you will have to go to [dialog](http://[supsystic-show-popup id=105]) and make changes. Of particular interest are:

- _per request_ - this is the number of records that will be displayed on a page. Configure the Pagination property to enable user navigation to various pages of data;
- _data on input change_ - this property defines when the data displayed will be refreshed. When enabled the data is reloaded whenever the input to the Variable (in the form of filter fields for Live and parameter values for Database API Variable) changes;
- _data on page load_ - enabling this property will ensure that the data within the data table is loaded at the time of page load.

Under the Data tab of a Variable you can:

- input fields with values for insert/delete/update
- Filter fields with values for read

### Source

can be a source of data in some cases. For example, you might want to display the results from a Live Filter or more details of a current item/selected row/item from a Data Table or List. Widget option will allow you to achieve this. Selecting Widget as the data source will display the various options available. Widget binding will allow you to show 1-many relationships, for example- Employees of a selected Department list item.
