WaveMaker release 11.8.1 is majorly a bug fix release which includes the issues with vulnerability and other User Interface (UI) issues. This release also has a new CSS class for Lottie Player and a few React Native and Cordova bug fixes.

---

## React Native Enhancement

**CSS Style Class in Lottie Widget**

Added a new CSS style class, `.app-lottie-content` allowing users to customize styles like height, width, and other properties in the [Lottie](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/lottie/) widget.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with the Nested Datatable where users were unable to edit table values after clicking the Edit button.

:::note

Users are now able to edit the values inside the Datatable used inside a Datatable.

:::

- Fixed an issue in the REST APIs where body parameters were not generated in the associated Java code when using the x-form-urlencoded content type.

:::note
Added a fix for Swagger generation and Java REST service invocation to accept all content formats for parameters.
:::

- Fixed an issue in the Datatable widget where the Title field key-value under Columns in Advanced Settings was incorrectly bound to the i18n Localized Messages. This key-value was replaced with the locale value whenever the user switched the workspace.

Before the fix: Locale value was bound in the Title field

After the fix: Key value was bound in the Title field

- Fixed an issue in the Datatable widget where the **Row Expand** icon did not update when the row was expanded.

:::note
Fix: This issue occurred when multiple classes were provided in the **Expand icon** and **Collapse icon** fields under Row Details.
::: 

- Fixed an issue in the Select widget where validation checks failed when using an updated dataset that did not include previously selected values. 

:::note

Updated the input value associated with the Select widget, as undefined. This makes sure that the validation checks fail.

:::

- Fixed an issue in mobile applications where the option to select a default value in the Select widget within a Form widget was not displayed.

:::note
:::

- Fixed vulnerability issues related to the use of **sonarqube-scanner** and **owasp-dependency-check** libraries for security checks during application generation.

:::note
Fix: Upgraded the following library versions to clear out any vulnerability issues.
    - sonarqube-scanner: 2.8.2 -> 4.0.1
    - owasp-dependency-check: 0.0.21 -> 0.0.23
:::

- Fixed issues identified during **npm audit** for generated applications, which revealed:
  - Moderate issues: 5
  - High-risk issues: 12
  - Critical issues: 4

:::note
Replaced core-js-builder library with rollup library as core-js-builder caused most of the vulnerability issues. Also upgraded the following library versions.
    - @compodoc/compodoc: 1.1.19 -> 1.1.25
    - summernote: 0.8.18 -> 0.8.20
The @compodoc/compodoc and summernote libraries were upgraded as they are used for Angular documentation and [Richtext Editor](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/richtext-editor/) widget respectively.
:::

- Fixed an issue where VCS actions were blocked even after the theme was approved for use.

:::note
This issue occurred when a theme developed in one project was published and imported by team members into their own projects.

To address this, a pop-up screen was added called **Artifacts Updates** that appears after theme approval. This screen allows users to update the theme with changes made in the original parent project.

:::

- Fixed an issue where leaving the Form field empty updated the dataset in the first static variable but not in the second static variable.  

:::note

This issue was observed in the Form widget, where the form data output is assigned to the first static variable, and the value of the first static variable is then used as input for the second static variable.

:::


### React Native

- Fixed an issue in the Text and Number widgets where resetting the dataset value to 0 resulted in a blank space on the preview screen instead of displaying the value.

:::note
Two-way binding capability has been added to Text, TextArea, Currency, and Number components.
:::

- Fixed an issue with the Video widget where the page displayed a blank screen if width and height values were not provided.

:::note
Fix: Default width and height values were provided.
:::

- Fixed an issue where Pages with Skeleton Loader did not render.

:::note

Introduced some delay in the change in the Skeleton widget while hiding it.

:::

- Fixed an issue where the Lottie player widget did not render in the application after the Lottie player library upgrade in Expo 50.

:::note

Added default width and height property values in the Lottie widget.

:::

- Fixed an issue with Dialog widget where the title did not display when the `Iconclass` property was left empty.

:::note
The title will now be displayed if a title value is provided, even if the Iconclass property is left empty.
:::

- Fixed a height issue in the Select widget where the dropdown field was displayed larger than the provided size.

:::note
To fix this issue, the default padding for the select drop-down field is reduced to half.
:::

- Fixed an issue where the accessibility IDs were missing in the following widgets
  - Anchor
  - Button
  - Icon
  - Accordion
  - Tabheader
  - Wizard
  - Chips
  - Datetime
  - Appnavbar
  - Progress-bar
  - Progress-circle spinner.

:::note
Added accessibility IDs in the widgets where it was not available.
:::

- Fixed an issue in the Select widget where the background image was not displayed even after binding an image to `background-image` property.

:::note
Now the `background-image` property can be detected in Select widget and render the image provided in the property.
:::

- Fixed an issue where the user was not able to set the text alignment in the Label widget using properties or style options provided in the studio.

:::note
Removed default `alignself` property from label widget which was earlier overriding the provided styles by a user.
:::

### Cordova Fix

- Fixed an issue with XHR calls that caused failure in displaying the Google maps in applications.

:::note
Added `readystate` property in native XHR that handles API calls.
