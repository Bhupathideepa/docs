caption is the text that the end user sees on your label.

name is a unique identifier for Toggle widget.

text or an HTML you enter for this property will be shown as a tooltip if the mouse hovers over this widget for 1.5 seconds.

index

tab index attribute specifies the tab order of an element. You can use this property to change the default tabbing order for widget access using the tab key. The value can range from 0 to 32767. The default is 0 and -1 makes the element non-focusable.

NOTE: In Safari browsers, by default, Tab highlights only text fields. To enable Tab functionality, in Safari Browser from Preferences -> Advanced -> Accessibility set the option "Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage".

width of your widget can be specified in px or % (i.e 50px, 75%).

**Value**

is the default value to display value for an editor widget. Note that the display value is just what the user sees initially, and is not always the dataValue returned by the widget. It is set to by default.

required editor in wm.LiveForm may refuse to save without a required field.

determines whether or not a component is visible. It is a bindable property.

on Demand (visible only when show property is bound to a variable)

this property is set and show property is bound, the initialization of the widget will be deferred till the widget becomes visible. This behavior improves the load time. Use this feature with caution, as it has a downside (as we will not be able to interact with the widget through script until the widget is initialized). When show property is not bound the widget will be initialized immediately.

the disabled property is true (checked) the value of the editor cannot change. The widget becomes display-only.

\[Alt\] + shortcut key (_/Linux_)

\[Control\] \[Alt\] + shortcut key ()

\[Alt\] \[Shift\] + shortcut key (_/Linux_)
