**WaveMaker Devtool** is a Google Chrome extension, an addition to the existing Google Chrome developer tools that allow you to debug and monitor WaveMaker applications in preview mode. Accessible via the **Inspect** option.

## Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser
- Be Logged into WaveMaker to view the logs

## Why WaveMaker Devtool

Typical challenges that WaveMaker application developers experience while debugging.

1. Developers go through many application logs when an issue is observed; for example, when adding new changes to the application, the page does not load. 
2. Developers often miss out on immediate details of the issue to determine which variables are responsible for the request and fix the encountered issue. 

### How Devtool can help

WaveMaker has developed the **WaveMaker Devtool** Chrome extension to ease the debugging process and improve the application performance. You can easily identify duplicate requests triggered on the page and check which requests take more time to respond to.

## Who can use WaveMaker Devtool 

All WaveMaker users who use Google Chrome to preview the application can install the **WaveMaker Devtool** extension and use it. 

## Using the WaveMaker Devtool 

Once you install the extension and preview a WaveMaker application on Preview mode, you can:

1. View the duplicate requests triggered on the page using the **Show only duplicates** option. 
2. Find the variable associated with each request along with the request URL. 
3. Switch to **All APIs** to view all the requests triggered by the page. By default, the **Core APIs** of the page are shown.
