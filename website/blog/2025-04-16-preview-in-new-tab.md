​WaveMaker has improved the Preview experience by eliminating the pop-up window. Previously, users had to remove the toolbar, copy the URL, and open it in a new tab. 

This little dance happened more times than we can count. And we get it - our users simply didn’t want the hassle of switching between pop-up windows.

So, we’ve made the switch. Now, clicking Preview opens the app directly in a new browser tab, streamlining the process and enhancing usability.

## What's Changed?

Starting with the release v11.11, when you hit Studio Preview, your app will open directly in a new browser tab instead of a pop-up window. This change brings a smoother, more consistent experience and makes it easier to navigate and manage your workspace - no more hunting for floating windows.

If the preview tab is already open and you click Studio Preview again, the tab will automatically refresh, so you’ll always see the latest changes without needing to switch tabs or refresh manually.

## Why This Matters

- No more pop-ups
- Better browser behaviour - dev tools, tabs, navigation all work seamlessly
- Feels modern and frictionless

## Small Change, Big Impact

This may seem like a minor tweak, but it's one of those details that improves your daily workflow in subtle but meaningful ways.

We’re committed to removing friction, one step at a time.
