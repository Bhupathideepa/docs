WaveMaker is here with CORE and Implementation (IMPL) projects, where a CORE project acts as the base with all the common functionalities. This allows multiple teams to work collectively on top of it. 

IMPL projects are the ones created as child projects of the CORE project to add more features or customizations. Changes made to the CORE project can be pulled into the IMPL projects periodically, making reusability seamless and boosting team collaboration.

## Publishing CORE Project

You can create a CORE project that would become the foundation for the implementation projects. To make the CORE project available for the team to use, it has to be published.

1. In the ProjectsHub, create a new project.
2. Once the CORE project is created with common features, select **Publish as Core** option.
3. Fill in the required details and submit for approval under the Core Apps section in the Teams Portal.
4. Click on Done to publish a CORE project.

## Creating Implementation Project

The IMPL project is created on top of the base CORE project with added features and customizations.

1. In the ProjectsHub, while creating a new project, select from CORE.
2. Select the CORE project and the version number of the CORE project.
3. Click on Done to create an IMPL project.

## Fetching CORE upgrades in IMPL Project

The added advantage of using CORE and IMPL projects is, that you can always fetch the CORE upgrades in the IMPL project without necessarily creating the IMPL project from scratch on top of the upgraded CORE project.

1. Once an updated CORE version is available, you can click on the upgrade icon in the IMPL project.
2. Choose the upgraded version and proceed. A temporary branch is created and can be found in **View brand and project details**.
3. You will be directed to a Merge Conflicts page where you can validate the changes and resolve conflicts.
4. Click on Finish Upgrade to remove the temporary branch and push the changes to the main branch.
