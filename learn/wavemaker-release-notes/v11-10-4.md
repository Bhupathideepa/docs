​WaveMaker's Release 11.10.4 is packed with numerous bug fixes for both Web and React Native platforms. This update also features important enhancements, including custom titles for web routes, customizing the base path while importing REST services in Web, and introducing an aspect ratio property for images in React Native.

---

## Enhancements

<details><summary> Custom Title For Web Routes </summary>

Introducing custom titles for web routes enhances user experience by displaying meaningful page titles in the browser's tab. Now, when users navigate to a specific page, database, Java service, or any other route, the title updates accordingly to reflect the route name with the **Page name**, instead of displaying the generic website domain like WaveMaker. This improvement provides a more user-friendly and intuitive experience for route-based navigation.

</details>

<details><summary> Customizing Basepath while Importing Rest Service </summary>

In this release, we have enabled users to customize the basepath of the rest services while importing. Currently, the endpoints of the deployed services look like this,  

`cloud.wavemakeronline.com/[TEAMS_NAME]/[APPLICATION_NAME]/`

Now, when a webservice is imported, the basepath is taken as the [TEAMS_NAME] and rest of the URL, `[APPLICATION_NAME]/services/....` is the Java layer.

With this enhancement, users will be able to avoid any issues that might arise when changing the application name as the application name is hardcoded in the Java service layer.

</details>

### React Native

<details><summary> Aspect Ratio Property for Images </summary>

​A new property, aspectRatio, has been introduced to the Picture widget, allowing users to bypass the default natural width and height calculations. 

**Example:** By specifying an aspect ratio, users can set one dimension, such as width: 100%, and the other dimension, height, will be automatically calculated and rendered based on the provided aspect ratio.

</details>


## Bug Fixes

<details><summary> Support for Promises in Wizard Widget</summary>

In the Wizard widget, users previously had to manually trigger API calls when attempting to navigate to the next step, if the **Next** callback returned false. With the current change, Promises have been integrated into the Next callback. This allows for asynchronous checks before proceeding, enabling users to skip the current step and move forward seamlessly.

</details>

<details><summary>Users Unable to View Action Button and Subheading</summary>

In the Data Table widget, it was observed that the users were unable to view new action button and subheading upon binding with variable.

<details><summary> Unable to View Total Record Count in Single Page </summary>

<details><summary> Incorrect Date Format in Datetime Widget</summary>

In the Datetime widget, the Date constructor does not support certain formats like dd/mm/yyyy. As a result, when the user provided input in the dd/mm/yyyy format, JavaScript interpreted it as mm/dd/yyyy, leading to incorrect dates.

</details>

<details><summary> Duplicate Name Issue in Custom Icons </summary>

An issue was observed and fixed in case of Custom icons, where users were able to use the same name for multiple custom icons that were imported.

<details><summary> Error Message Issue during Database Reimport </summary>
