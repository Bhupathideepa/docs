## Connector Introduction
Connector is a Java based backend extension for WaveMaker applications. Connectors are built as Java modules & exposes java based SDK to interact with the connector implementation.

Each connector is built for a specific purpose and can be integrated with one of the external services. Connectors are imported & used in the WaveMaker application. Each connector runs on its own container thereby providing the ability to have itâ€™s own version of the third party dependencies.

Multiple connectors can be orchestrated inside an WaveMaker application to implement business logic.

## Highlights of a Connector
- onnector is a java based extension which can be integrated with external services and reused in many WaveMaker applications.
- Each connector can work as an SDK for an external system.
- Connectors can be imported once in a WaveMaker application and used many times in the applications by creating multiple instances.
- Connectors are executed in its own container in the WaveMaker application, as a result there are no dependency version conflict issues between connectors.
