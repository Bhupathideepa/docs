**Live Filter** provides data filtering UI and functionality. Live Filter can be bound to a data source from the database through the Database CRUD Variable. It returns filtered results which in turn can be bound to any widget. When designing in WaveMaker, Live Filter offers the following features to be configured:

- filter fields style and display formats,
- specify the range filtering for numeric fields,
- specify the number of records to be filtered,
- filter behavior in case of empty or null results,
- specify the match mode,
- specify a cascading filter,
- different layout styles like 1-column, 2-column or 3-column
