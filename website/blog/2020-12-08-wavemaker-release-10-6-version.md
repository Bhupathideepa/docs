## Upgraded to Angular 9

With [Angular 9.0.0 update](https://blog.angular.io/version-9-of-angular-now-available-project-ivy-has-arrived-23c97b63cfa3), be on the latest version of the technology stack, and access to the up-to-date Angular material and framework with improved performance and CLI.

With the Angular 9 upgrade, WaveMaker applications support AOT compilation by default, however, it continues to use View Engine for rendering instead of Ivy. We expect to support Ivy in the next major release WaveMaker-11.

:::note
With the Angular 9 update, you can expect to see an increase in the application build time.

## Spring Session Persistence

WaveMaker apps use the spring-session-core library for session management. With this, it can offload the storage of the session state into external session stores. For example, you can use REDIS or any regular database that WaveMaker supports. By default, [In-memory](/learn/app-development/app-security/session-persistence#in-memory) map implementation is set which will work just fine for a single node application. Plus, you can use other implementations such as REDIS, JDBC. [Learn more](/learn/app-development/app-security/session-persistence).

## Page Cache and Retain State for Widgets

Restore page by using [Page Cache](/learn/app-development/ui-design/page-concepts/page-cache) and restore widget state or share URL of a specific state of the widget by using [Retain Widget State](/learn/blog/2020/11/09/Retain-UI-State-on-Wavemaker-Apps).

## Mobile Updates

### Alternative to PhoneGap

As PhoneGap was [deprecated by Adobe](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-5-6#mobile-updates). WaveMaker is in the process of developing a Mobile App Build Service that is integrated with WaveMaker Studio (releasing soon). Meanwhile, We released a service called AppChef (similar to PhoneGap) which internally uses [wm-cordova-cli](/learn/hybrid-mobile/mobile-build-manual). To build APK or IPA, export Cordova Zip from the WaveMaker Studio and upload it to AppChef. [Learn more](/learn/hybrid-mobile/mobile-build-appchef).

### Command-Line for Building Cordova Zip

Export a project as Cordova Zip from WaveMaker Studio as well as generate Cordova Zip from the exported application using maven commands. Libraries are hosted in the public npm registry (Angular library), and Maven (Jars). Therefore, all the required libraries are available to use without needing to import Zip files manually.

Plus, we have introduced a new manual build process to generate Android and iOS applications locally. To learn more, see [Manual Mobile Build](https://www.wavemaker.com/learn/hybrid-mobile/mobile-build-manual).


## Up-to-date Libraries

WaveMaker has upgraded the versions of Spring, Hibernate, Log4j to Log4j-2. To know our detailed list of updated libraries, see [WaveMaker 10.6 Technology Stack](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-6-0#technology-stack).

## External CI-CD for Web and Mobile

WaveMaker supports external CI/CD for both web and mobile apps from 10.6.0 onwards. It makes WaveMaker much more flexible to work with Studio or outside WaveMaker Studio.

## Docker Upgrade

Docker upgrades to the latest version i.e `19.03.13`. WaveMaker supports all versions which are greater than `>19.03`.
