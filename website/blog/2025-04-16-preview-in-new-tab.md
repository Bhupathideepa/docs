​WaveMaker has enhanced the app preview feature to make it more user-friendly. Previously, clicking [**Preview**](/learn/app-development/dev-integration/developer-tools/#preview) opened the app in a pop-up window, requiring extra steps like removing toolbars, copying URLs, and opening new tabs. Now, starting with [version 11.11](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v11-11-0/), clicking **Preview** opens the app directly in a new browser tab.

If the preview tab is already open and you click Studio Preview again, the tab will automatically refresh, so you’ll always see the latest changes without needing to switch tabs or refresh manually.

## Why This Matters

- No more pop-ups
- Better browser behaviour - dev tools, tabs, navigation all work seamlessly
- Feels modern and frictionless

### Small Change, Big Impact

This may seem like a minor tweak, but it's one of those details that improves your daily workflow in subtle but meaningful ways.
