## Enhancement 

<details> <summary> Gift Box for Product Updates </summary> 

We have improved our Gift Box feature, making it easier for users to view the latest updates. Key enhancements include:

- **Dynamic Notification List**: The notification list now automatically updates with each new release, showing the latest updates.
- **Auto-Open Feature**: When users log into the Project Hub, the Gift Box automatically opens, displaying unread notifications relevant to that user in a dialog box.
- **Read Status Tracking**: Notifications are marked as Read once opened. As users navigate through the dialog, each notification is marked as read.
- **Unread Count Badge**: A badge on the Gift Box icon displays the count of unread notifications, keeping users aware of new updates.

### React Native

<details> <summary>Scrollable in Container Widget</summary>

Introduced a new property in the Container widget that allows users to scroll the items available within the Container widget. To enable scrolling, the `Scrollable` property is set as true and the below code is added in the Markup.

```xml
<wm-container name="container1" scrollable="true" color="#93a7cf">
                <wm-list listclass="list-group" itemclass="list-group-item" template="true" template-name="Text List" itemsperrow="xs-1 sm-1 md-1 lg-1" class="media-list" statehandler="URL" dataset="bind:Variables.chartdata2.dataSet" navigation="Pager" name="list3" deferload="true"
                    pagesize="5">
                    <wm-listtemplate layout="inline" name="listtemplate3">
                        <wm-label caption="bind:Variables.chartdata2.dataSet[$i].name" class="h4" padding="12px" name="label3"></wm-label>
                    </wm-listtemplate>
                </wm-list>
            </wm-container>

```

## Bug Fixes

</details>

<details> <summary>FileUpload Widget Fixes</summary>

Addressed the below issues in FileUpload widget. These issues were faced when multiple option was enabled to upload multiple files.

- The larger file upload progress stopped when the smaller file that was uploaded after the larger file was successfully uploaded.
- The status of the file uploaded after the larger file was not displayed. This was observed when the larger file which was uploaded first was still in progress.

</details>

<details> <summary>Fixed Accessibility Issues</summary>

Resolved multiple accessibility issues across all widgets, except the Chart widget, to enhance compliance with accessibility standards and improve usability for all users.

</details>

<details><summary> Database Designer Fixes </summary>

With this release, Database Designer issues were addressed enhancing the performance and making the implementation smoother.

</details>

## React Native Fixes

<details><summary>Unable to Change Default Icon</summary>

In Search widget, users were unable to change the search icon. Now, `iconclass` property is exposed to modify the icon.

Syntax to be added

</details>

<details><summary>Value is getting Auto-erased </summary>

An issue was observed in Text, Number, and Textarea widget, when the field was bound. The entered value inside these fields disappeared when user shifted the focus from these fields.

</details>

<details><summary> Search option in Emulator is not Visible </summary>

When using the Search widget at the top of the screen, the search field is scrolling up when the keyboard is opened. This behavior was caused by the keyboard-avoiding feature. With this fix, the content will no longer shift upward unless the keyboard overlaps it, ensuring a smoother user experience.

</details>

<details><summary> Flickering UI Issue </summary>

Users observed screen flickering when entering values in the Text widget. To address this, a new lazy option is added to the `Update On` property, introducing a 100ms delay to minimize flickering.

</details>

<details><summary> Checkbox Set and Radio Set Fixes</summary>

Previously, users were unable to add customization in CheckboxSet and Radioset widgets. Introduced a CSS class, `.app-checkboxset-selected-label` to customise the background color, border radius, font weight, and other properties.

</details>

<details><summary> Hamburger Menu Width Issue</summary>

Previously, users were unable to customise the width of the left panel that opens upon clicking the Hamburger menu icon. Currently, the width of the left panel occupies only half of the screen by default. To address this issue, a new key, **leftNavWidth**, can be added in **wm_rn_config.json** file to allow width customization.

</details>

<details><summary> Text is not Blurred</summary>

Addressed an issue in Text widgte where the blur event did not trigger upon entering the value in Text widget. This was observed when the value in **Update Value on** property value was set as keypress.

</details>

<details><summary> Lottie Widget Issue</summary>

An issue was observed with the Lottie widget: where the preview failed when users added the Lottie widget and linked it to an animation file.
