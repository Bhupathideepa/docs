WaveMaker 11.7.1 is here with a new feature, PR Flow. This release also includes enhancements like i18 message customization, extended Semantic Versioning, disabling Prefab editing in a project, and other bug fixes.

## New Features

### PR Flow

To support internal reviews, WaveMaker has introduced developer branching. Now, when a user pushes code, a development branch is created in the code repository. With this, the changes pushed by the developer can be reviewed instead of automatically merging the changes to the Remote Tracking Branch (RTB).

## Enhancements

### Full Semantic Version Support for Prefabs Publishing

Earlier we used to support the Semantic versioning to publish an Artifact that included the Major.Minor.Patch details of the artifact. Now, we have extended this support to add the Pre-release and build details of the Artifact. For example, 1.2.1-beta+1234, where,

- **1**: Major
- **2**: Minor
- **1**: Patch
- **beta**: Pre-release
- **1234**: Build

### Disable Prefab editing inside the Application

With this support, users need to apply their code changes in the parent Prefab and publish the changes to view it in the same Prefab when used in the project as we are disabling the support to edit the Prefab code within the project.

### i18 message Customization in Prefabs used in a Project

Now, we have extended our support to allow the editing of i18 prefab messages within the project. This eliminates the need to manually edit the messages in the en.json or af.json files available in the file explorer, making it easier to customize the prefab messages inside the project.

## Other fixes

### Support for Runtime Version Switching in New Studio

Runtime patches are used to address bugs or regression issues in the runtime of both web and React Native applications. They are easy to apply and with this feature, it becomes easy to revert to another runtime version. Without any downtime, the user can roll back to previous deployment versions.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the landing page visible upon logging in is now determined by the priority settings specified in the App Roles section when the user is assigned multiple roles.
- Fixed project runtime version defaulting to base runtime version when a new user joins or a branch project created in a project using supported runtime version.
