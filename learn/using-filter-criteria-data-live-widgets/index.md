: To apply filter criteria on referenced entities in Data and Live Widgets.

- Criteria option available for referenced fields.
- of the where clause that will be built based on the specification.

:

1. WaveMaker Web Application, with a database imported (we are using the sample HR Database).
2. Data and Live Widget bound to Employee CRUD variable.

: We are using the example of a **Form** Same can be implemented for Live Filter and Data Table with Quick Edit and Inline Editable layouts, with some changes as mentioned in the next section.

1. the **Settings** dialog for the Live Form.
2. the tab, select the Â field (referenced entity).
3. the **Criteria** property. Click the **Criteria** icon to access the Filter Criteria dialog. [![](../assets/liveform_filtercriteria1.png)](../assets/liveform_filtercriteria1.png)
4. you can specify the conditions for applying the row filter on specified field values.
5. condition is called a Criteria and multiple conditions can be categorized into a Group.
6. /Groups can be joined by AND/OR expression.
7. conditions can be selected from the given drop down. The conditions are pre-populated based upon the filter field data type.
8. Criteria Preview gives you the filter expression based on the criteria and groups that you add.
9. can delete any criteria or group. [![](../assets/liveform_filterfields.png)](../assets/liveform_filterfields.png)
10. can see the query built for the field [![](../assets/liveform_filtercriteria.png)](../assets/liveform_filtercriteria.png)
11. you preview the app, only the values satisfying the filter criteria will be available for selection [![](../assets/liveform_filtercriteria_run.png)](../assets/liveform_filtercriteria_run.png)

The above process can be used for Data Table with Quick Edit and Inline Editable layouts and Live Filter with the following changes:

- **Edit and Inline Editable Data Tables**
    
    - Columns tab from the Advanced Setting dialog lists all the fields from the referenced entity.
    - Criteria option is available only for the primary key field, under Edit Mode.
