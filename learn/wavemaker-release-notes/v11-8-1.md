WaveMaker release 11.8.1 is majorly a bug fix release which includes the issues with vulnerability and other User Interface (UI) issues. This release also has a new CSS class for Lottie Player and a few React Native and Cordova bug fixes.

## React Native Enhancement

**CSS Style Class in Lottie Widget**

Added a new CSS style class, `.app-lottie-content` allowing users to customize styles like height, width, and other properties in the [Lottie](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/lottie/) widget.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue in the case of Nested Datatable, where the user was unable to edit the table values even after clicking Edit.

:::note

Users are now able to edit the values inside the Datatable used inside a Datatable.

:::

- Fixed an issue in Rest APIs where the body parameters were not getting generated in the associated Java code while using content type as x-form-urlencoded.

:::note
Added a fix during swagger generation and java rest service invocation that accepts all the content format for parameters.
:::

- Fixed an issue in the Datatable widget where the Title field key-value available under Columns was bound to the i18n Localized Messages. This key value was replaced with the locale value once the user switched the workspace.

Before the fix: Locale value was bound in the Title field

After the fix: Key value was bound in the Title field

- Fixed an issue in the Data table widget where the **Row Expand** icon did not change when the row was expanded.

:::note
Fix: This issue occurred when multiple classes were provided in **Expand icon** and **Collapse icon** fields under Row Details.
::: 

- Fixed an issue in the Select Widget where validation checks did not take place while using the updated dataset that does not include previously selected values. 

:::note

Updated the input value associated with the select widget, as undefined. This makes sure that the validation checks fail.

:::

- Fixed issue in mobile applications where the option to select the default value in the Select widget used inside a Form widget was not displayed.

:::note
:::

- Fixed vulnerability issues like while using **sonarqube-scanner** and **owasp-dependency-check** libraries for security checks during application generation.

:::note
Fix: Upgraded the following library versions to clear out any vulnerability issues.
    - sonarqube-scanner: 2.8.2 -> 4.0.1
    - owasp-dependency-check: 0.0.21 -> 0.0.23
:::

- Fixed issues that came up while running the **npm audit** for generated applications. The list of vulnerability issues had,
  - Moderate issues: 5
  - High-risk issues: 12
  - Critical issues: 4

:::note
Replaced core-js-builder library with rollup library as core-js-builder caused most of the vulnerability issues. Also upgraded the following library versions.
    - @compodoc/compodoc: 1.1.19 -> 1.1.25
    - summernote: 0.8.18 -> 0.8.20
The @compodoc/compodoc and summernote libraries were upgraded as they are used for Angular documentation and [Richtext Editor](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/richtext-editor/) widget respectively.
:::

- Fixed an issue where the VCS actions were blocked even after the Theme was approved to be used.

![Artifacts Updates](/learn/assets/update-popup-themes.png)

:::note
This issue occurs when a Theme developed in one project is published and imported by team members to use in their projects.

Added a pop-up screen, Artifacts Updates, that would appear after the Theme approval. In this screen, the user can update the Theme with the changes applied in the Theme used in the parent project.
:::

- Fixed an issue when the Form field was left empty it updates the dataset in the first variable but not in the second static variable.  

:::note

This was noticed in the Form widget where the form data output is assigned to the first static variable as input and the data value of the first static variable is assigned as input to the second static variable.

:::


### React Native

- Fixed an issue in the text and number widgets where the user had to reset the dataset value to 0 is not displayed on the preview screen.

:::note
Twoway binding capability has been added to Text, TextArea, Currency, and Number components.
:::

- Fixed an issue with the Video widget where the page with Video content displayed a blank screen when width and height values were not provided.

:::note
Workaround: Default width and height values were provided
:::

- Fixed an issue where the Pages with skeleton loader did not render.

:::note

Introduced some delay in the change in the Skeleton widget while hiding it.

:::

- Fixed an issue where the Lottie player widget did not render in the application after the Lottie player library upgrade in Expo 50.

:::note

Added default width and height property values in the Lottie widget.

:::

- Fixed an issue with dialog widgets where the title was not displayed when Iconclass property was left empty.

:::note
Now the title will be displayed if the title value is provided even if the Iconclass property is left empty.
:::

- Fixed height issue in the Select widget where the select dropdown field was displayed slightly bigger in size than desired.

:::note
To fix this issue, the default padding for the select drop down field is reduced to half.

  - anchor
  - button
  - icon
  - accordion
  - tabheader
  - wizard
  - chips
