API Composer Toolkit eliminates several steps in designing and developing the API that uses multiple services, including REST, Swagger, Database, and Java Service. To simplify the API orchestration, we generate Java code for each service, including the service and the required model you'd need. 

When creating a Java Service, these dependencies can be viewed and enabled from the right panel.

To use the rendered services and model, expand the desired service by clicking the service.

Select the required method, which automatically adds the autowired annotation in the Java Service.

Apply custom business logic to the autowired annotation, and then use the API to integrate it with the UI layer, including widgets.
