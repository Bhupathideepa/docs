*WaveMaker released a new update version with some new features and bug fixes.*

## New Features

---

### Work in Branches

- Create branches for a project in WaveMaker Studio for hotfixes and features.
- Develop, preview, and test applications.
- Branch operations such as create, merge and delete are required to perform on the source controller, i.e., outside WaveMaker.
- This feature is enabled on request for WMO Teams subscribed customers.

### VCS Enhancements

- Support for project grouping in VCS.  
- Create a project from the existing VCS repository URL (empty).
- Provision to display the repo URL for a project.
- Default branch for any VCS repository.

### NPM Artifacts

- Follows standard front-end way to publish and make it available to global developers.
- Easily install and explore in a trusted public server accessible 24/7.
- No more the need for S3 storage.

### Support for Red Shift Database

- Connect to an existing database in AWS RedshiftDB from a WaveMaker application. 
- Store petabytes of data in easy-to-access "clusters" that can be queried in parallel.

### Support for SAP Hana Database

- Connect to SAP Hana Cloud database and configure the relational database schema in WaveMaker.
- Use In-Memory Database to store huge databases for analysis or information processing.

### Allow Hosts

- Configure hostnames as domain names.
- Determine which hostnames to allow to run applications.
- Validate a URL redirection that also protects against HostHeaderInjection.

### Schema Optimaztion

- Faster database imports due to the optimized queries running in the background.

### Other Improvements

- Introduced a new property called **Prefer Browser Language**.
- For Rest/Swagger services, the rest call goes from the backend when you enable proxy, making the direct path empty in service definitions.

## Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed an issue related to the tabs onChange not triggering when swiping from one tab-pane to another in mobile apps.
- Fixed issues related to service call failure and server not reachable errors on the applications installed on iPad.
- Fixed an issue related to multi-select items not working in the list widget when a web application launches in n iPad and Safari browsers.
- Fixed an issue related to the Datetime widget throwing validation error in mobile devices when the Output Format property is set to a different type other than Timestamp.
- Fixed an issue related to focusing Form fields in mobile and iPad browsers when the Form is inside the list with reordering enabled.
- Fixed an issue related to reordering records on a list widget. Unable to move the records up/down with pagination set as an infinite scroll.
- Fixed an issue related to text widget input type when changing from password to email and vice versa using Javascript.
- Widget/content configured to a specific device should be rendered in DOM only in that device view, and variables bound to that widget shouldn't be invoked. Similar for container type widgets with partial content. // need clarity
