1. **Attributes**: Define the content to be displayed in a widget by connecting it to a database query, web service, Java method, or another widget. Data binding provides integration with data sources known as ‘Variables’ or any other Widgets. Variables offer the ability to integrate with services such as a database, web service or any other backend service. [on Variables and Binding](/learn/app-development/variables/data-integration/)
2. : Use the  tab in the  **Panel** to define styles. Widget styles for alignment such as margin, padding, text & background, and border styles can be customized as per the required look-n-feel. Advanced users can switch to the Style  **Mode** to edit the code.  [on Styling](/learn/app-development/ui-design/page-artefacts/#page-style "Markup, Scripting and Styles")
3. **Binding**: Use the  tab in the  **Panel** to choose the action for specific events. Widgets expose click, mouse enter/leave events, tap and double tap for multiple devices, which can be bound to Variables or methods of Services.

4. : Use the  tab in the  **Panel** to choose the widget visibility. Manage the widget visibility across device sizes
5. **Control**: Define which user roles can access the widget in the  tab of the  **Panel**  [on role-based access](/learn/app-development/app-security/access-levels-permissions/ "Role-based Access Control") and [security](/learn/app-development/app-security/access-levels-permissions/#role-based-access)
