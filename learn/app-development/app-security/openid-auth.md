In this document we will be describing about the Open ID authentication using Identity providers.

---

OpenID Auth is a type of authentication protocol to log into the application. Users can use the login credentials provided by an OpenID provider, to establish a session with another application. OpenID providers are the third-party authentication servers that provide the authenticated ID to user, allowing them to use multiple applications without creating a separate account and password for each. List of few OpenID providers is provided below:
* Google
* Okta
 

## Stateless Authentication Session establishment using OpenID

### Stateless Authentication

Stateless authentication, also known as Token-based authentication, includes tokens to authenticate a user request to access any service and/or fetch a resource. This token contains user and client information that is used to identify user. 


1. User initiates the process by accessing an application.	
2. Application provides User with options to choose the desired identity provider via authentication request as soon as the User tries to login to the application.
3. User gets directed to the identity provider to provide necessary details for authentication and authorization purposes.
4. Identity provider successfully verifies the userâ€™s identity and returns the required user details.
5. User successfully logs into the application and the role is assigned to the user
6. Session gets established between user and application.

### Example

Twitter is a well-known social media application. This application also uses OpenID authentication. As soon as the user tries to login, user is provided with few identity providers like Gmail and Apple. User can then choose a desired identity provider to log into Twitter.


# Why OpenID Authentication?

OpenID Authentication comes with many advantages. Some important reasons to choose OpenID authentication are:

### Simple Sign-up process

In WaveMaker user is provided with few secure identities by OpenID providers like Google, Facebook and so on, that allows the user to login with a single click. This removes the efforts and time that user spends to feed the redundant information to use an application.


### Minimum efforts to maintain usernames and passwords:

Users do not have to invest much of their efforts in keeping track of multiple usernames and passwords. Developers also find it beneficial as they are not required to design additional logic to store and maintain the usernames and passwords, specific to any application.


### Lower Password security risks

Users tend to have same passwords and usernames for many applications. This may pose a huge security risk as it becomes easy to hack into the user's account in every application. Instead, if the user is provided with an identity by OpenID provider, it reduces the risk of hacking into all the accounts. If the security is anyhow compromised, the user has to only change password to the identity provider and the data stays secure.


## Steps to start OpenID Configuration

1. Select a project, click on the security option.

## OpenID Authentication Security Configurations

OpenID Authentication security configurations facilitate communication between the application and Identity provider.

### Identity Provider Information

| Field | Description |
| ---- | -----------|
| Provider ID | Allows User to select the Identity Provider |
| Authorization URL | This is the endpoint that initiates the authentication of the end user |
| Token Url | This is the endpoint used to communicate Access token, ID token and refresh token |
| JWKS Url | Json Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint stores the information on public keys used to verify the Json Web tokens |
| User Info Endpoint | User Info endpoint allows the client application to fetch the required claims about the authenticated end user |
| Logout Url | This endpoint is used by the client application to erase provider-side session and related cookies |



### Service Provider Information

| Field | Description |
| ---- | -----------|
| Redirect Url | Redirect endpoint is the url to which the client receives the response |
	

### Integration Information

| Field | Description |
| ---- | -----------|
| Client ID | This acts as the unique identity for the registered client |
| Client Secrets | It is a client specific information that is only known to application and the authorization server. This acts as application's password |
| Scopes | Scope parameter is used to authorize access to user information |
| User Name Attribute | This field allows to configure the attribute value that is associated with the user name that is fetched from the identity provider |
	

### Role Mapping

**Prerequisite:** User must switch in the Search User Role mapping option.
| Field | Description |
