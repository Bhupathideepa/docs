You can set the **Home Page**, **Default Language** and **Display Format** for date and time fields. To set the **Default Language** and **Display Format** fields in General settings tab, you can follow the below steps.

### Setting Default Language

As the name suggests, by using **Default Language** field, you can set the default language in the application.

1. Go to Settings -> General.
2. In General settings page, select the default language from the drop down in the Default language field.

:::note
Ensure that the language selected as default is already added in Localization. To know how to add a new language in Localization, see [Localization Using Select Locale](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/select-locale-usage#step-1-app-messages).

Similarly, you can set the date and time using the **Display Format** field.

:::note
The Language and date/time format selected at the widget level will get priority over the General setting.
