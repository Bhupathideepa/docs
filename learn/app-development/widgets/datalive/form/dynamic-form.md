Dynamic Form is a form that renders the fields and layout based on received Metadata where, Metadata is the data regarding the Form fields. In this case, no information about the fields or layout is available and can only be determined with the Metadata. Dynamic forms are most appropriate when the metadata changes frequently based on business models and are driven by another user role. For example, a Business Analyst can determine the fields in a form for targeted customer.

|   Form   |   Dynamic Form   |
|--------|----------|
| Static display with Fixed fields and labels | Interactive display No fixed fields and labels |
| Upfront knowledge about fields i.e Validation, layout, widget type, formatting etc | No configuration is done upfront, only metadata is available |

## Benefits of Dynamic Form

### Provides Business Users more configuration/customization capabilities

Dynamic forms are metadata-driven, which allows business users to configure the fields to be displayed, in what order, and how to be displayed, in real time. These forms are created with simple UI that takes inputs from business users regarding the fields.

### Update forms without frequent deployments

Dynamic form are constructed over metadata, where they provide necessary details about the data such as name, type, widget type, validation rules which helps in avoiding repeated deployments to add new field details as it is done in static forms. Fields can be added in real-time by Admin as per the requirement, as the metadata already contains the field details.
