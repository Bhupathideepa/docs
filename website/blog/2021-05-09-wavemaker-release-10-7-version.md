As Ralph Waldo Emerson says, "A good system shortens the road to the goal." Point well taken. With this release, let's see how we aim to achieve this.

## What's new

- **[Working in branches](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#work-in-branches)** offers more than just tracking developers' changes. Organize branches to plan features and hotfixes simultaneously, independently. 


- While support for branching requires some enhancements to **[how VCS operates](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#vcs-enhancements)**, including how you manage projects, groups, and organizations. See how these changes our current system [here](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#vcs-enhancements).


- Are you already a part of the Amazon ecosystem? In that case, we have good news for you. With the **[support of the Redshift database](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#support-for-red-shift-database)** in WaveMaker, get speedy, high performance, horizontally scalable, with the ability to add massive capacity storage - all in the cloud. 


- Are you using **[SAP HANA](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#support-for-sap-hana-database)** in your SAP modules? With the introduction of SAP HANA, import the SAP HANA database into WaveMaker for seamless integration of column-based data model. It improves flexibility, performance and uses an in-memory store with the read and editable modes.

- Limitations to access public servers apply to most organizations. We understand. **[UI Artifacts](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0#ui-artifacts-now-published-to-npm)** publish to the npm package manager. Incorporate UI Artifacts and simplify CI-CD pipeline using standard npm repo without worrying about firewall restrictions safely. 

### Bug Fixes 

Fixing bugs is equally important as adding new features to the system "to shorten the road to the goal." We dealt with some of the critical bug fixes in this release. See the full list of [bug fixes here](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-7-0/#bug-fixes).
