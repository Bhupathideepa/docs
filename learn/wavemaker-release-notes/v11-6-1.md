WaveMaker 11.6.1 is here with multiple enhancements like dynamic passing of CDN URL as system property, **Show** field for edit mode in Data Table widget, conditional classes for few input widgets and improved security Role Mapping configurations along with many bug fixes related to new studio based on Angular.


## Enhancements

- Introduced support to configure CDN URL for web application as a system/env property. This is to allow users to dynamically pass the CDN URL value that will be fetched at the application startup.
  :::note

  `cdn-url` property has now been deprecated and is updated as the `app.cdnUrl` property.

  :::

- In the Data Table widget, we have introduced the **Show** field for the edit mode in the Advanced settings dialog. This improvement can be used to show or hide the values in the table even in the edit mode.
- Introduced conditional class and conditional style support in Text, Textarea, and Number widgets.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the user was not able to view API details when switching between REST and Swagger APIs.
- Fixed the issue with the Artifacts where the artifacts created by the user, who was removed from the team, were not listed in the Team Portal.
- Fixed an issue in the Menu widget where the menu drop-down gets automatically closed as the cursor moves away from the menu even if the `auto close` property value is set to `outside click`. 
- Fixed the issue where the user is unable to update the prefab version even after a force update.
- Fixed an issue where the validation error message is not thrown for the custom form fields.

## New Studio
