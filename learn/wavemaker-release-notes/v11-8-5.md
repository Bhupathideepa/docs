## New Feature - React Native

<details> <summary>Embedding React Native into Native Applications</summary>

Now, React Native can be integrated into Native Applications using CLI commands allowing developers to use the advantages of React Native such as cross-platform development and faster iteration, while maintaining or enhancing an existing native codebase.

With this feature users can benefit from the following advantages.
- **Modernize Existing Apps**: Integrate modern, interactive UI components into legacy native applications without a full rewrite.
- **Speed Up Development**: Utilize React Nativeâ€™s rapid development cycle with hot reloading, allowing faster UI iterations.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce development time and costs by reusing code across platforms.

## Enhancements

<details> <summary>Skeleton Loader Improvements</summary>

With the recent improvements, user can apply Skeleton Loader not only by using WaveMaker default configuration, but also using Lottie animation. Lottie animation can be used in the cases where the Page, Prefab, and Partial contain components that do not support WaveMaker default configuration to apply Skeleton Loader.

Other improvements in Skeleton Loader are listed below.

- Users can now hide or show the child components available inside a container widget by using `showskeletonchildren` property. When `showskeletonchildren` property is set to true, Skeleton Loader is applied to the child components and are displayed. When it is set to false, only the parent container widget is displayed like a card component and the child components gets hidden.
- Page, Prefab, Partials, and Charts can now get the Skeleton Loader applied using the Lottie animation. This can also be used in the cases where the users want custom Skeleton Loader to be displayed for the components. To implement this, user can add a custom JSON animation file as resource using `skeletonanimationresource="PATH_TO_JSON_RESOURCE"`. For furtherconfiguration like animation speed, users can use `skeletonanimationspeed="SPEED_REQUIRED"`.
- In List widget, users can now provide the number of widgets to be displayed in skeleton mode by using the `numberofskeletonitems` property. The value of this property is set to 3 by default.
