## Tranforming React Native Studio to Angular

We have upgraded the React Native Studio framework to the latest version of Angular, following a similar approach to the previous WaveMaker Studio upgrade. This enhancement significantly improves the overall user experience for React Native Studio users.

To know more about the upgrade, see [WaveMaker Studio Upgrade Blog](/learn/blog/2024/03/04/wavemaker-11-6-release#whats-new)

## Enhancements - React Native

<details> <summary>Expo 52 Upgrade</summary>

Introducing Expo 52, with ehancements and features to address critical pain points, new capabilities, and refine existing tools.

Users can look forward for the following key benefits,

- **Reduced Latency**: JavaScript Interface (JSI) allows direct function calls between JavaScript and native modules. This reduces delays and enhances real-time performance.
- **Enhanced Performance**: The JSI allows direct access to native C++ objects. This improves execution speed for heavy tasks, making apps faster and more reliable.
- **Scalability for Complex Projects**: The updated architecture simplifies development with a unified, modular design, enabling direct JavaScript-native code access for greater flexibility and scalability in complex projects.

<details> <summary> Select Widget Drop-Down </summary> 

A new class, `select-dropdown`, is added to the Select widget, allowing dropdown options to be displayed directly on the same page under the Select widget. This feature improves usability and enhances the user experience.

## Bug Fixes

<details> <summary> Errors displayed in Wavetool</summary>

- During accessibility verfication in Wavetool, an **Empty Link** error was flagged for the pagination. This was observed when pagination was set to Classic Mode in Data Table.
- Another error, **Empty Table Header**, was flagged in Wavetool when Radio column behavior was enabled for a Data Table.

</details>

<details> <summary> onChange Event Issues</summary>

- When the form within the dialog contains a number widget as a form field and Update Value on is set to **blur**, the **onChange** event is not triggered the first time when entire value is deleted from the form field. This was observed when a default value was already set for the Number widget.
- In case of the number widget, an issue was observed when Update Value on is set to **blur**, the **onChange** event is triggered immediately upon entering a value during the first time preview, even without blurring out of the widget.

</details>

### React Native

<details> <summary> Webview Styling Issue </summary>

Previously, users were unable to customize the Webview widget and its content. With this fix, two properties, `.app-webview-content` and `.app-webview` are exposed where,

- **.app-webview**: helps you customize the Webview widget container properties like border width and height.
- **.app-webview-content**: helps you customize the content within the Webview widget.
