*WaveMaker released a new update version with features and bug fixes.*

## New Features

---

- A new flag called 'Cache' is introduced on Page tag. Using this flag, one can specify whether to use a cached page on re-visit. Using a cached page, significatly improves render performance. By default, this flag is turned off. [Click here](/learn/app-development/ui-design/page-concepts/page-cache) to know more about this 'Cache' flag.

### Mobile

- WaveMaker is creating mobile app build service that is fully integrated with WaveMaker studio. It will be released in the near future. Meanwhile, to help WaveMaker developers, WaveMaker is releasing a service called AppChef (Similar to PhoneGap). This AppChef internally uses [wm-cordova-cli](/learn/hybrid-mobile/mobile-build-manual). To build apk or ipa, a developer has to export cordova zip from the studio and upload it to AppChef. [Click here](/learn/hybrid-mobile/mobile-build-appchef) to know 'How to use AppChef'. 

## Improvements

### Mobile
- Upgraded to Cordova@10.0.0 and Cordova-ios@6.1.0. [Click here for more details](/learn/blog/2020/11/26/cordova-10.0.0-upgrade).
- Added purpose of each ios icon in 'export cordova zip' dialog.
- Till now, apps created in WaveMaker support both iPhone and iPad by default. When developer wants to support only iPhone, there is no control to specify this preference. In this release, a new preference called 'Target Device' is added under ios preferences in 'export cordova zip' dialog. Using this preference, developer can specify whether app supports iPhone or both iPhone and iPad. For old projects, this option is set as 'iPhone and iPad'. For new projects, this option is set as 'iPhone'.
