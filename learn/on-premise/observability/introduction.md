Did you ever wonder how a Human body automatically responds to any negative inconvenience?

The body fixes itself with a *Negative Feedback Loop*, which detects the anomalies and performs the required actions to maintain a stable, relatively constant
 internal environment.
 
 Example:

*Wouldn't it be great if you had an application with a similar mechanism?* 

Well, we have Engineered the WaveMaker Platform to do the same.

With the right tools, WaveMaker Platform is smart enough to detect its internal failures and the Engineer at WaveMaker are never blinded to anything which
 needs his attention.

All this is possible due to the WaveMaker's **Observability** module.

> There are many more features offered by this module besides the one mentioned above.

With the Observability module in place, we can proudly say that WaveMaker truly "owns" its product because it knows exactly what is happening inside the
 system at any point in time, the whole platform is under complete control.
 
WaveMaker's Observability module consists of the following components.

- [Logs aggregation](/learn/on-premise/observability/logs-aggregation/overview)
    - [Kibana](/learn/on-premise/observability/metrics-collection/metrics-collection/kibana)
- [Metrics collection](/learn/on-premise/observability/metrics-collection/overview)
    - [Prometheus](/learn/on-premise/observability/metrics-collection/prometheus)
    - [Alerts](/learn/on-premise/observability/metrics-collection/alerts)
    - [Grafana](/learn/on-premise/observability/metrics-collection/grafana)
