You can change the Rating widget style at the runtime, using the Â event. Using the example from the [section with Variable data](/learn/how-tos/rating-widget-using-variable/), here we will see how.

1. to the event of the Rating widget. [![](../assets/rating_usage_statvar_event.png)](../assets/rating_usage_statvar_event.png)
2. the following script. This script captures the rating value as changed by the user, and changes the color of the widget appropriately. : Use the rating widget name from your app in place of _1_ in the following code.
    
    1Change = function ($event, widget, newVal, oldVal) {
        if (widget.datavalue == '1') {
            Page.Widgets.rating1.color = 'red';
        } else if (widget.datavalue == '2') {
            Page.Widgets.rating1.color = 'blue';
        } else if (widget.datavalue == '3') {
            Page.Widgets.rating1.color = 'blue';
        } else if (widget.datavalue == '4') {
            Page.Widgets.rating1.color = 'green';
        } else if (widget.datavalue == '5') {
            Page.Widgets.rating1.color = 'green';
        }
    };
    
3. the app, based upon the rating selection see the color change.
