- Supporting provision to include or exclude specific URLs.
- Export project as zip now includes ‘generated-rn-app/**', 'generated-angular-app/**’ files.
- Added Subtitle attribute in the Wizard widget.

- Fixed an issue related to the Carousal widget where the **nav** tag is replaced with the **div** tag.
- Fixed an issue in React Native Apps, where a boolean value passed to the prefabs as an inbound property is not overriding the default value.
- Fixed an issue in React Native, in which the Modal dialog is not opening from another dialog.
