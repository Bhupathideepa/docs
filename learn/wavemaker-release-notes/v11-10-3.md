## Enhancements

<details><summary> Selecting JWS and Opaque Security Providers </summary>

With this release, users can now select and cofigure JWS and Opaque security providers in security settings page like other security providers.

To apply JWS and Opaque security providers, users need to select the options from the Security Provider drop down available in Security under Settings.

</details>

<details><summary> Readable Version Names for Artifacts </summary>

Introducing Readable version filed for artifacts. Users can now add the readable version name while maintaining alignment with the Standard Version. This feature enhances clarity and usability by providing a customized display option for version information.

**With Readable Versioning**

(Readable Version)(Standard Version)

Example: CK-NI-Web-prefatis-card-1.5.9 (1.5.19)

**Without Readable Versioning**

(Standard Version)

Example: 1.5.19

:::note
Users can export with the readable version name along with the standard version details but once exported, the readable version in the target instance cannot be modified.

</details>

<details><summary> Case Insensitive Sorting </summary>

In this release we have added a new property, **Case-Insensitive Sort**. This property is to enable sorting without distinguishing between uppercase and lowercase letters. This property is available only for Model variables and Service variables and is shown when the **Enable Sort** property is enabled.

Case-Insensitive Sort property can be enabled to the column level in the Advanced Settings dialog.

Additionally, in model variables, date fields were previously treated as strings, causing incorrect sorting. Now, dates are sorted in proper chronological order.

</details>

<details><summary>Elaborated Hint Text For Chart Values </summary>

Introducing an enhancement that allows adding detailed hint text for x-axis values in Line charts. For example, if the x-axis displays dates in the **DD, MM** format, this feature enables the display of an expanded format, **DD, MM, YYYY**, when hovering over the x-axis labels. Implementing this functionality can enhance data readability and user interaction within your charts.

To add the elaborated hint text for chart values, use the below code.

```javascript

Page.chart3Beforerender = function (widget, chartInstance) {
    setTimeout(function () {
    d3.selectAll("text")
        .on("mouseover", function (event, d) {
            const textElement = d3.select(this);
            // Remove existing title if present
            textElement.select("title").remove();

            // Retrieve original x, y values from the dataset
            const xValue = widget.chartData[d].Date;  // Assuming dataset contains {x: ..., y: ...}
            const yValue = widget.chartData[d].Amount;

            // Append new title with dataset values
            textElement.append("title")
                .text(`x: ${xValue}, y: ${yValue}`);
        });
}, 1000);
}

```
