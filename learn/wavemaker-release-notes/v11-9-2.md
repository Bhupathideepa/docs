## Bug Fixes

<details> <summary> Database Designer Fixes </summary>

In this release, Database Designer issues related to Read-Only Mode alignment, dissapearing content aftersaving the changes, and other issues were addressed enhancing the performance.

</details>

<details> <summary>Artifact Update Dialog Issue</summary>

In Artifact Updates dialog, user can view the latest prefab versions and update the prefab to the desired latest version. Previously, in the Actions column, users were still viewing the latest version drop down even after updating the prefab to the latest version. Now, with the fix, users can only see a **tick** in the Actions column if the Prefab is already updated to the latest version.

</details>

<details> <summary>Multipart APIs Request Failure</summary>

With the upgrade to Spring 6, servlet api was used for parsing parts in API. The 500 internal server error was thrown when custom filters in the application use request.getInputStream and the multipart API request was invoked.

</details>

<details> <summary> Bar and Column Chart - Tool Tip Issue </summary>

An issue was observed in Bar and Column chart widgets where the Tooltip showed the previously value provided during creation even though the new values were provided to be displayed when the user hovers over the bar or column.

</details>


## React Native Fixes

<details> <summary> Red Border in Number Widget </summary>

In the Number widget, the input field was showing a red border without any validation error. This issue was observed the input field was bound to a variable and the following Update On property changes

- when **Update Value on** property was set as **blur**.
- when **Update Value on** property was set as **keypress** and the page was loaded.

It was also noticed and fixed in the List widget where the red-border showed when the **Update Value on** property was set as blur, and it occurred when edited. 

</details>

<details><summary>Value is getting Auto-erased </summary>

An issue was observed in Text, Number, and Textarea widget, when the field was bound. The entered value inside these fields disappeared when user shifted the focus from these fields.

</details>

<details><summary> Search option in Emulator is not Visible </summary>

When using the Search widget at the top of the screen, the search field is scrolling up when the keyboard is opened. This behavior was caused by the keyboard-avoiding feature. With this fix, the content will no longer shift upward unless the keyboard overlaps it, ensuring a smoother user experience.

</details>

<details><summary> Flickering UI Issue </summary>

Users observed screen flickering when entering values in the Text widget. To address this, a new lazy option is added to the `Update On` property, introducing a 100ms delay to minimize flickering.

</details>

<details><summary> Checkbox Set and Radio Set Fixes</summary>

Previously, users were unable to add customization in CheckboxSet and Radioset widgets. Introduced a CSS class, `.app-checkboxset-selected-label` to customise the background color, border radius, font weight, and other properties.

</details>

<details><summary> Hamburger Menu Width Issue</summary>

Previously, users were unable to customise the width of the left panel that opens upon clicking the Hamburger menu icon. Currently, the width of the left panel occupies only half of the screen by default. To address this issue, a new key, **leftNavWidth**, can be added in **wm_rn_config.json** file to allow width customization.

</details>

<details><summary> Text is not Blurred</summary>

Addressed an issue in Text widgte where the blur event did not trigger upon entering the value in Text widget. This was observed when the value in **Update Value on** property value was set as keypress.

</details>

<details><summary> Lottie Widget Issue</summary>

An issue was observed with the Lottie widget: where the preview failed when users added the Lottie widget and linked it to an animation file.
