Since WaveMaker is built on java, we use *Slf4j* and *logback* java libraries to generate the required logs in the platform level.

All the logs generated by each and every microservice are aggregated by integrating the EFK Stack. 

### EFK Stack

One of the most popular centralized logging solution is the **E**lasticsearch, **F**luentd, and **K**ibana (EFK) stack.

- **Elasticsearch** : This is is very efficient when it comes to dealing with huge volumes of data. We can easily filter the required Logs.  
- **Fluentd** : Collects the application logs, transforms them into required formant and pushes the transformed data to *Elasticsearch*.
- **Kibana** : Since data can't be directly accessed fom *Elasticsearch*, *Kibana* provides a powerful UI which helps in accessing or visualizing the logs.
  
> We will be focusing more on [*Kibana*](/learn/on-premise/observability/logs-aggregation/kibana) as *Elasticsearch* and *Fluentd* are only used as a
> part of integration.  

### Architecture

The below image shows the architecture of EFK stack

![Kibana Home Page](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/efk-architecture.png)

Here, The **microservice** containers labeled **A**-**Z** are spread across instances **10.0.0.1** - **10.0.0.N**

Each and every instance contains a "**fluentd**" container which collects logs from the microservices present in the same instance.

Then, *fluentd* transforms and pushes this data to the **Elasticsearch**
 
Finally, **Kibana** can directly access the logs as it is connected to *Elasticsearch*
