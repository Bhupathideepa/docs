WaveMaker has released version 11.5.0 with new features including Appium Support, Dockerfiles in a project, and enhancements like Angular framework support for Prefab workspace, NG studio upgrade to version 15, and other bug fixes.

## New Features

### Dockerfiles in Project

Introduced Dockerfiles in the project to build and deploy applications. This helps the user to use an appropriate Dockerfile for a specific project which stores all the prerequisite versions that are needed for the application.

### Appium Support - React Native

Appium is a popular mobile UI test automation framework, and it supports various programming languages to write test cases. In WaveMaker, the component generates a unique identifier that is based on the widget name and attaches it as a testId property on all React Native elements that it uses.

### Docker Image for Local Web Preview - React Native

Introduced **wm-rn-web-preview** Docker image to allow users to generate the local web preview of the application. Docker image is pre-configured with essential libraries which lets the user update to the latest version of the development environment by pulling the latest docker image. This simplifies the process of building and running Wavemaker applications in the local environment. 

### Importing Icon font family in Project - React Native

Introduced an option to import font family into a project allowing users to add a custom font family.

## Enhancements

### Angular Framework for Prefab Workspace

Earlier WaveMaker supported Angular framework for Page Workspace in Web projects that is now getting extended to Angular framework support for the Page Workspace in Prefab projects.

### OpenID JWKS File Path

Extended support for reading the public key from a file path for the JWKS configuration.

### NG Studio 15 Upgrade in Application Run time
