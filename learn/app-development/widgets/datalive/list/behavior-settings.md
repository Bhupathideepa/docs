1. **Selection Limit**: This property sets the maximum items that can be chosen at run-time. It also determines whether the list can have single or multiple items selected. This property can be bound to a variable to determine the selection limit at run-time.
2. **Multiselect:** Multiselect will enable users to select multiple list items at runtime. These items can be captured via the _selecteditem_ which will be an array of objects. See Usage Scenarios for more details.
3. Item Reordering: **Enabling reorder** will enable users to reorder the list items at run-time.
4. **Disable Item**: This property will disable all the events on the item and other widgets present it.
