WaveMaker app development process involves three steps as described earlier. 
- <span style="color: #D3D3D3;">Step-1: Drag-and-drop widgets and design the page.</span>
- <span style="color: #D3D3D3;">Step-2: Create a backend service.</span>
- **Step-3: Using variable, integrate the backend service with widget.**

When your backend service is ready, you use variable to bind a connection between the UI widget and backend service.

The **binding layer** provides a _low-code approach_ to defining data flows, interaction, and integration of UI elements with the backend services. This functionality is achieved through the Binding layer, using the following components.
