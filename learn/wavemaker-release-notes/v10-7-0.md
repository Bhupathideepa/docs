*WaveMaker released a new update version with some new features and bug fixes.*

## New Features

---

### Work in Branches

- Create branches for a project in WaveMaker Studio for hotfixes and features.
- Develop, preview, and test applications.
- Branch operations such as create, merge and delete are required to perform on the source controller, i.e., outside WaveMaker.
- This feature is enabled on request for WMO Teams subscribed customers.

### Support for Red Shift Database

- Connect to an existing database in AWS RedshiftDB from a WaveMaker application.
- Store petabytes of data in easy-to-access "clusters" that can be queried in parallel.

### Support for SAP Hana Database

- Connect to SAP Hana Cloud database and configure the relational database schema in WaveMaker.
- Use In-Memory Database to store huge databases for analysis or information processing.

### VCS Enhancements

- Support for project grouping in VCS.
- Create a project from the existing VCS repository URL (empty).
- Provision to display the repo URL for a project.
- Default branch for any VCS repository.

### UI Artifacts now published to NPM

- All the UI artifacts required for generating and building the Angular app are now published to npm
- This removes the dependency on any other public cloud servers like s3 or other repo providers like maven
- This also simplifies the integration of the WaveMaker app to an enterprise CI/CD pipeline, as standard npm repo is used.

### Metadata Query Optimizations

- Metadata queries invoked in WaveMaker Studio to fetch the constraints information for the tables during the DB import operation have now been optimized to enable faster database imports in applications.

### Other Improvements

- Added support in the Deployed Apps portal to enable **Creation** and **Deployment** of application in 1.18 and 1.19 Kubernetes clusters in Digital Ocean.
- Introduced a new property called **Prefer Browser Language** under **Project Settings** with a default value set to `true`. When you set the property to false, the app loads in the default app locale irrespective of the locale set in the browser.
- Introduced the Allowed host property in the security tab of the profile configuration. It prevents host header injections and lets application developers control the allowed hosts of the application.
- Introduced the **Max Authentication Age** property in the project security configuration. It permits application developers to allow users to stay authenticated for an extended duration when the identity provider (idP) allows.
- Performance optimization for the `show-in-device` property for all UI widgets. If a widget is not shown in a device, it will no more be loaded in the DOM itself, making the DOM lighter and preventing any associated XHR calls.
- Introduced the `Max Sessions` property under the "Login configuration" section. With this, a developer can configure the duration for a logged-in user's session's life.
- For Rest/Swagger services, the rest call goes from the backend when you enable proxy, making the direct path empty in service definitions.
- Model variable allows enabling two-way binding from the variable dialog.
<! --- Concurrency control for application security with the properties including max-sessions and error-if-maximum-exceeded. 20425 --->
<! --- Add alias name for instances - 20410 --->
