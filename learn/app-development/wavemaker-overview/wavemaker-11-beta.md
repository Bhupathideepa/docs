We are back with a new release, and we can't wait to share all the great features and updates waiting for you in WaveMaker 11 beta.

With every new release, our goal is consistent. It is to simplify the low-code platform for developers and consultants to bring app ideas to life faster. While we are at it, we continue to provide great flexibility to customize app components and services that are completely reusable at their coreâ€”and take advantage of several open-source integrations on our way. Let's see what we got this year.

WaveMaker 11 beta release features significant advancements shaping the practicality of the low-code development for mobile consumers in a big way. Additionally, we touched all security points and covered you with extensive tooling capabilities, keeping the low code roots in mind.


## Introducing React Native in WaveMaker

We introduce React Native, a new platform for developing native apps, including iOS and Android app development, all within WaveMaker Studio. The best part is that it requires almost no learning curve if you are already a WaveMaker developer. It offers platform-specific versions of components so that a single codebase can share code across Android and iOS stores. [Read more](/learn/react-native/react-native).

### Cordova Support Continues

Although our emphasis at this point is to prioritize React Native, even so, we do not plan to deprecate Cordova anytime sooner. We will continue to support Cordova app development and provide an up-to-date tech stack whenever a new update is available. 

## New Widgets in Studio

We are persistent in producing rich studio tools that enable you to design great-looking apps using our new Linear and Flex widgets. These widgets allow you to display data in list format, giving developers complete control of vertical and horizontal layout adjustments. This feature is exclusive to React Native users for now. 

## API Composer Toolkit

API composer toolkit can be your playground to compose an object using multiple API endpoints. This means you can combine many REST APIs in Java Service and write custom business logic that you can use as a variable and bind to any UI widget.  

## API Mock Server

API Mock Server is our own WaveMaker Studio extension. It simulates a backend API with responses that are close to accurate for developing the UI design even if you do not already have a backend service to use. This is great for the app designing phase, while the backend team can develop the APIs simultaneously. For more information, see [API Mock Server](/learn/app-development/services/api-mock-server).


## Java 11 Updates Tech Stack But Brings a few breaking changes

Java 11 version brings along a few break changes and version bumps. If you build and deploy apps outside WaveMaker, you must upgrade your build infrastructure and verify the deployment setup to support Java 11. For this reason, we introduced parallel versioning of Studio so you can test your application before you upgrade to WaveMaker 11 beta. 


## Parallel Versioning: Multi-studio

We ship multi-studio versions to make the migration process smooth. The project card converts into a folder that contains two versions of the same project, including versions 10 and 11.
