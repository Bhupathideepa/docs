        //$data has the data of the all widgets inside the live filter. This data can be modified and validated before sending the request.
        $data.tenantid.value = 1; //Values can be set for some specific fields.
    };

event will be called after API returns a success response.

1Success = function($data) {
        //$data has the fitlered response returned from the API.
        console.log("The filtered data:", $data);
    };

1Error = function($data) {
    //$data has the error message returned from the API.
    console.log("Error returned from server:", $data);

- filter data:
    
     = 1; 
    //Sets the value to filter field deptId to 1 and filters the data.
