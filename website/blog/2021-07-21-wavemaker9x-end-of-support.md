The end of Support (EOS) stage marks the official withdrawal of support for projects of WaveMaker 9.x versions. 

## What does the end of support for WaveMaker 9.x entail?

WaveMaker will end support of WaveMaker 9.x projects by 31 Dec 2021, and this means if you are using 9.x projects, WaveMaker will automatically update to the latest version of WaveMaker. This update can break explicitly on projects that contain custom code. 

Following 31 Dec 2021, we shall not be supporting project migrations. Therefore, we highly recommend you update your projects to receive support before the established deadline.

## Will my apps continue to work, and how long?

If you have already deployed the 9.x WaveMaker application, it will not be affected by the change. However, making alterations would no longer be possible for the app. 

## What does end of support mean for customers?

The deployed apps will not be affected by the change to the end-users if not modified and stays in the orginal state.

## What happens if you do not upgrade to WaveMaker 10?

For WaveMaker Online (WMO) users, application projects will automatically upgrade to the latest version of the Studio. 

For WaveMaker Enterprise (WME) users, you will no longer receive support and we cannot offer licence extension.

## Why is WaveMaker ending support for the 9.x version?

- Outdated application stack: AngularJS has ended the support, including security issues (31 Dec 2021). https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/version-support-status
- Performance improvements: 
Security vulnerabilities in the dependent third party libraries
Enabling micro frontend enablement
Support for new compression technique - https://docs.wavemaker.com/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-2-0#enhancements
Wavemaker-generated code is Veracode certificated.
Latest angular stack, which is Angular 10

## What is changing? 

We can point to release notes and add a progress diagram if needed. 


## How WaveMaker will help in upgrade process?

Updating Angular is not straightforward. However, our developers have made it easier for you. When you initiate an update, WaveMaker takes care of most of the process behind the scenes smoothly and effortlessly. 

Even so, if you have included customizations, i.e., adding custom code, you'll then have to check and accept changes manually by verifying every single customization that runs through the process. This approach is taken care of by the inspection framework that we explicitly developed to guide you through the migration process.
