Introducing Readable version filed for artifacts. Users can now add the readable version name while maintaining alignment with the Standard Version. This feature enhances clarity and usability by providing a customized display option for version information.

<Readable Version> (<Standard Version>)

Example: CK-NI-Web-prefatis-card-1.5.9 (1.5.19)

<details><summary> Case Insensitive Sorting </summary>

In this release we have added a new property, **Case-Insensitive Sort**. This property is to enable sorting without distinguishing between uppercase and lowercase letters. This property is available only for Model variables and Service variables and is shown when the **Enable Sort** property is enabled.

Case-Insensitive Sort property can be enabled to the column level in the Advanced Settings dialog.

Additionally, in model variables, date fields were previously treated as strings, causing incorrect sorting. Now, dates are sorted in proper chronological order.
