WaveMaker has released version 11.3.5, which includes enhancements for the Googlemap Prefab, pagination, as well as bug fixes for nested menus, app crashing, and database queries and procedures.

## Enhancements

- **Googlemaps** Prefab updated from version 7.0.0 to 7.0.1. This update introduces new properties to allow for more precise control on the positioning of the zoom and street view controls in the Googlemaps Prefab.
    - Zoom Control Position
    - Street View Control Position

- **Infinite Scroll** and **OnDemand** pagination introduces the **Show View Less Button** property, allowing you to add the "View Less" button when using these pagination methods.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue highlighting the active items in nested menu specifically on the header navigation. The selected menu, including sub-menus, is properly highlighted as expected.
- Fixed the issue causing the WaveMaker application to crash and become unresponsive when a large number of roles (1000s) and several pages are configured under the Security settings.
- Fixed the issue where the **setSummaryRowData()** function returns incorrect data when used with procedures and database queries.
