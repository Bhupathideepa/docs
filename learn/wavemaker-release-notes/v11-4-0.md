WaveMaker has released version 11.4.0, which includes new features like Core project and a few React Native features, such as a toggle option in Web Preview, Live Form, and Database Variables. This release has many enhancements like support for language fonts, indication mark in the Select widget, and so on along with bug fixes.  

## New Features

### Core and Impl Projects

A **Core Project** (CORE) in WaveMaker is a template that contains the common functionality of an application. Multiple team members can work on it before deploying it. 

**Implementation Project** (IMPL) can be created as child project of the CORE project to add more features or customizations to IMPL. Changes made to the CORE project can be pulled into the IMPL projects periodically.

Example: 
- The **Core Project** is like a house blueprint.
- The **Implementation Projects** are like the different houses that are built based on the blueprint.

:::note
Core and Implementation Projects are currently in beta and can be accessed upon request through our Support team.

### API ReImport Impact Analysis

Typically, re-importing an API in an application can affect the application's behavior due to the API update.

The **API ReImport Impact Analysis** feature provides a detailed report on how updating a target API can affect the application's program elements, such as widgets, variables, and more. Impact analysis report can greatly improve the developer experience, especially during iterative development.

API ReImport Impact Analysis is currently in beta and can be accessed upon request through our Support team.

### New in React Native

#### Turn On/Off Web Preview

Introduced a toggle option to view the application in web preview. This option allows you to either preview it directly else use the given cli command to preview it in the local environment. To know more, see [Local Web Preview](/learn/react-native/generate-web-preview-locally/).

#### Database Variables

Introducing the Database CRUD variables in the React Native platform of WaveMaker Studio allowing users to connect an individual database entity through auto-generated CRUD APIs. Learn more about [Database Variables](learn/app-development/variables/database-crud/).

#### Live Form

- WaveMaker has introduced the Live Form widget in the React Native platform to provide a columnar group of input elements for user entry to perform CRUD operations on the associated database. Learn more about [Live Form Widget](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/live-form/).

## Enhancements

- Added language-specific behavior like font that can be specified inside language-specific app classes. For example, use the CSS class `.app-{localecode}` to mention different font families.
- Added an indication to show the selected option in the Select widget.
- Refactored the security files in the project, by moving the spring beans related to security from XML configuration i.e. project-security.xml, which was generated in the studio design time to java configuration in the runtime.
- Added support to include or exclude specific URLs.
- Included ‘generated-rn-app/**', 'generated-angular-app/**’ files while exporting a project as zip.
- Added Subtitle attribute in the Wizard widget.
- Added Checkbox and Radio button to the Tree widget.

### Expo Version Update

- **[Expo](https://blog.expo.dev/expo-sdk-49-c6d398cdf740)** updated from version 48 to 49 for React Native apps.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed running JUnit test cases for WM projects in the Maven build.
- Fixed an issue to retain user-configured prefab properties in the development profile on updating the prefab version.
- Fixed an issue related to the Carousal widget where the **nav** tag is replaced with the **div** tag.
- Fixed an issue in React Native Apps, where a boolean value passed to the prefabs as an inbound property is not overriding the default value.
- Fixed an issue in Cordova apps, in which the Modal dialog is not opening from another dialog.
- Fixed an issue in Cordova apps, where the dialog remains open when the Datetime widget is used.
