A new zero-day vulnerability was reported in the Spring library on **29th March 2022**, affecting the library versions **5.3.0 to 5.3.17, 5.2.0 to 5.2.19,** and older versions. The vulnerability impacts Spring MVC applications running on JDK 9+. 

Spring has released a new version on **31st March 2022, 5.3.18**, which fixes the vulnerability. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. The [blog post added by Spring](https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement) has more details about the vulnerability.

## Is WaveMaker Application Affected?

WaveMaker 10 Apps are compiled using Java 8 and supported to deploy on Java 8 only. So ideally, WaveMaker apps are not affected. Applications deployed on Java 9+ have slight chances of being vulnerable if the controller methods use **@ModelAttribute** or no annotation. WaveMaker generated controllers, by default, either use **@RequestParam** or **@PathParam** or @**RequestBody**, which shouldn't cause any issues. 

We recommend mitigating your application using one of the steps mentioned below in the blog. WaveMaker will release a hotfix to address the Spring upgrade very soon.

## Risk Mitigation

Below are two ways that can be followed to mitigate the risk before the planned hotfix release.

### Maven Upgrade the Spring Version Manually

Add the latest version of spring framework bom (5.3.20) as the first dependency under the <dependencies> section of <dependencyManagement> section. Below content needs to be added.

```xml
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-framework-bom</artifactId>
 <version>5.3.18</version>
 <type>pom</type>
 <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
```

:::note
Ensure it is the first dependency, and it is before the `wavemaker-app-runtime-services` dependency.
:::
 
### Upgrage Tomcat Version

Upgrade the tomcat version to either 9.0.62 or 8.5.78, closing the attack vector on Tomcat's side.
