text or an HTML you enter for this property will be shown as a tooltip if the mouse hovers over this widget for _1.5 seconds._

index

tab index attribute specifies the tab order of an element. You can use this property to change the default tabbing order for widget access using the tab key. The value can range from 0 to 32767. The default is 0 and -1 makes the element non-focusable.

NOTE: In Safari browsers, by default, Tab highlights only text fields. To enable Tab functionality, in Safari Browser from Preferences -> Advanced -> Accessibility set the option "Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage".

width of your widget can be specified in px or % (i.e 50px, 75%).

is a composite widget with a label and a selector. The user can select from the range specified with the increment as defined by the step value.

determines whether or not a component is visible. It is a bindable property.

on Demand (visible only when show property is bound to a variable)

this property is set and show property is bound, the initialization of the widget will be deferred till the widget becomes visible. This behavior improves the load time. Use this feature with caution, as it has a downside (as we will not be able to interact with the widget through script until the widget is initialized). When show property is not bound the widget will be initialized immediately.

the disabled property is true (checked) the value of the editor cannot change. The widget becomes display-only.

**key**: The shortcut key property specifies a shortcut key to click the button. The way of accessing the shortcut key is varying in different browsers:

key Trigger

Explorer

\[Alt\] + shortcut key

\[Alt\] + shortcut key (_/Linux_)

\[Control\] \[Alt\] + shortcut key ()

\[Alt\] \[Shift\] + shortcut key (_/Linux_)

\[Control\] \[Alt\] + shortcut key ()

event handler is called each time your element's value changes.
