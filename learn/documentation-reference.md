[WaveMaker](https://www.wavemaker.com/) is a low-code platform for developing enterprise app. It is a design studio with over [80 widgets](/learn/app-development/widgets/widget-library) that work out-of-the-box for developing a rich and modern end-to-end application. Simply drag-and-drop widgets on the dashboard and integrate it with services. 

:::tip
Widgets are UI elements, which makes your app functional without coding. Explore the [widgets library](/learn/app-development/widgets/widget-library). 
:::

In WaveMaker, apps are built on the concept called [variables](/learn/app-development/variables/variables), which connect widgets with backend services. You can develop business logics using APIs, web services, java services, or write your own code to extend a feature. Integrate it with widgets in a few clicks and use them across the project. 

In addition, WaveMaker is also a simple-to-use solution for building apps faster with one-click deployment. In this section, you can find a complete developers' guide for building apps in WaveMaker Studio.
