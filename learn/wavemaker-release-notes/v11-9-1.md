</details>

<details> <summary>FileUpload Widget Fixes</summary>

Addressed the below issues in FileUpload widget. These issues were faced when multiple option was enabled to upload multiple files.

- The larger file upload progress stopped when the smaller file that was uploaded after the larger file was successfully uploaded.
- The status of the file uploaded after the larger file was not displayed. This was observed when the larger file which was uploaded first was still in progress.

</details>

<details><summary> Database Designer Fixes </summary>

With this release, Database Designer issues were addressed enhancing the performance and making the implementation smoother.

</details>

## React Native Fixes

<details><summary>Unable to Change Default Icon</summary>

In Search widget, users were unable to change the search icon. Now, `iconclass` property is exposed to modify the icon.

Syntax to be added

</details>

<details><summary>Value is getting Auto-erased </summary>

An issue was observed in Text, Number, and Textarea widget, when the field was bound. The entered value inside these fields disappeared when user shifted the focus from these fields.

</details>

<details><summary> Search option in Emulator is not Visible </summary>

When using the Search widget at the top of the screen, the search field is scrolling up when the keyboard is opened. This behavior was caused by the keyboard-avoiding feature. With this fix, the content will no longer shift upward unless the keyboard overlaps it, ensuring a smoother user experience.

</details>

<details><summary> Flickering UI Issue </summary>

Users observed screen flickering when entering values in the Text widget. To address this, a new lazy option is added to the `Update On` property, introducing a 100ms delay to minimize flickering.

</details>

<details><summary> Checkbox Set and Radio Set Fixes</summary>

Previously, users were unable to add customization in CheckboxSet and Radioset widgets. Introduced a CSS class, `.app-checkboxset-selected-label` to customise the background color, border radius, font weight, and other properties.
