## Migration

<details> <summary> Migrating React Native Studio to Angular 15 </summary> 

We have upgraded the React Native Studio framework from Angular JS to Angular 15, following a similar approach to the previous WaveMaker Studio upgrade. This enhancement significantly improves the overall user experience for React Native Studio users.

The key benefits this upgrade is bringing are:

- Improved UI for better navigation
- Enhanced the React Native Studio's interface with cleaner toolbar and enhanced text appearance for a more polished look and feel.

## Enhancement - React Native

<details> <summary> Select Widget Drop-Down </summary> 

A new class, `select-dropdown`, is added to the Select widget, allowing dropdown options to be displayed directly on the same page under the Select widget. This feature improves usability and enhances the user experience.

## Bug Fixes

<details> <summary> Accessibility Issues</summary>

Observed and addressed accessibility issues related to the Data Table.

</details>

<details> <summary> onChange Event Issues</summary>

- When the form within the dialog contains a number widget as a form field and Update Value on is set to **blur**, the **onChange** event is not triggered the first time when entire value is deleted from the form field. This was observed when a default value was already set for the Number widget.
- In case of the number widget, an issue was observed when Update Value on is set to **blur**, the **onChange** event is triggered immediately upon entering a value during the first time preview, even without blurring out of the widget.

</details>

### React Native

<details> <summary> Webview Styling Issue </summary>

Previously, users were unable to customize the Webview widget and its content. With this fix, two properties, `.app-webview-content` and `.app-webview` are exposed where,

- **.app-webview**: helps you customize the Webview widget container properties like border width and height.
- **.app-webview-content**: helps you customize the content within the Webview widget.
