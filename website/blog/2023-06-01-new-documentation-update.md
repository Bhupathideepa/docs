### Docsascode documentation framework

WaveMaker documentation site powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a popular documentation framework that follows docsascode (Documentation as Code) method. Docusaurus is an open-source tool that enables easy documentation creation and maintenance. WaveMaker has chosen docsascode method as the framework to power its documentation website for easy collebration with developers and writers. 

In this update, we migrated from Docusaurus V1 to V2, which automatically brings some exciting features out of the box. However, this migration wasn't without its challenges. Migrating a project of this scale required thorough testing. We conducted comprehensive reviews, addressing any issues and fine-tuning the codebase to ensure a seamless transition.

### Brand new design and refreshed look

The website has undergone a complete transformation, featuring a brand-new design and a clean refreshed look. The updated website delivers a seamless user experience with enriched content and improved accessibility.

The addition of a quick search functionality further enhances the user experience, enabling users to swiftly locate relevant content. Users can find relevant information by searching keywords or phrases. This can enhance the efficiency of locating specific content within the documentation.


### Enriched content and structured classification

The new documentation website provides a [structured classification](/learn/documentation-reference) of WaveMaker's **product features** and **extensions**, making it easier for users to navigate and find the information they need to help users understand and utilize WaveMaker's products effectively.

### Light and dark theme options

One exciting feature of the upgraded website is the ability to switch between light and dark themes. Users can now customize the website's appearance to match their IDE (Integrated Development Environment) preference, providing a comfortable reading experience.

### Access to older versions of documentation

The documentation website offers access to older versions of the documentation. This feature can be valuable for users who are using previous versions of WaveMaker's products and need access to the relevant documentation specific to their version.

### Edit and feedback provision

WaveMaker also values user feedback. The updated documentation website includes a feedback mechanism where users can provide feedback on specific pages, which creates an issue in GitHub. This enables users to share their thoughts, suggestions, or report any issues they encounter, helping WaveMaker continuously improve the documentation and address user needs effectively.

We hope that the upgraded website will provide you with an excellent resource to leverage the full potential of WaveMaker's products and extensions.
