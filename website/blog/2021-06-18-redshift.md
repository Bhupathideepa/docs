Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. You can start with just a few hundred gigabytes of data and scale to a petabyte or more.

With Redshift, you can query and combine exabytes of structured and semi-structured data across your data warehouse, operational database, and data lake using standard SQL. Redshift lets you easily save the results of your queries back to your S3 data lake using open formats, like Apache Parquet, so that you can do additional analytics from other analytics services like Amazon EMR, Amazon Athena, and Amazon SageMaker.

Amazon Redshift achieves efficient storage and optimum query performance through a combination of massively parallel processing, columnar data storage, and very efficient, targeted data compression encoding schemes.
Redshift internally uses PostgreSQL but few features that are available in PostgreSQL have been omitted by Redshift to improve performance.

## Redshift Architecture

![Redshift Architecture](/learn/assets/redshift-architecture.png)

Redshift is a data warehouse cluster which is a combination of nodes. If a cluster has two or more clusters then an additional leader node exists which coordinates between the nodes and handles external communication.
Each compute node has its own dedicated CPU, memory, and attached disk storage, which are determined by the node type. 

A compute node is partitioned into slices. Each slice is allocated a portion of the node's memory and disk space, where it processes a portion of the workload assigned to the node. The leader node manages distributing data to the slices and apportions the workload for any queries or other database operations to the slices. The slices then work in parallel to complete the operation.

## Redshift in WaveMaker

If you have already tried importing the Redshift database into WaveMaker with read-only mode, WaveMaker has extended its support to allow a dedicated option for Redshift. You can import a Redshift database with read and editable modes that you can customize further. Create variables to compose data using UI widgets like List, Data Table, and more. 

### Connecting to Database

Using the **Connect to DB** option allows you to import the Redshift database from the **Databases** menu. WaveMaker takes care of adding the driver dependency in `pom.xml`. 

For instance, in the following image, consider an employee table was imported into the project.

Using the above table, you can create List, Data Table widgets, etc., and perform CRUD operations on it.

### Using Redshift DB for Creating a List Widget

Drag and drop a List widget and configure the List widget by selecting the same employee table discussed in the earlier points.

After configuring the widget, you can preview the application and view the table data as a list.

### Editing Tables

When you import Redshift tables in editable mode, you can create new tables and modify existing tables from the database designer in WaveMaker instead of using the Redshift DB console.

### Do you already have a Redshift database?

You can directly import the Redshift database by following the how-to’s doc [Connect To AWS Redshift Database](/learn/how-tos/configuring-aws-redshiftdb#docsNav).

### In case you don't

Below are the steps to get you started to launch a Redshift cluster:

1. Sign in to AWS Management Console. Use the following link to open Amazon Redshift console − https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/
2. Create a Cluster and select the number of nodes, node capacity, and other database configurations.
3. After the cluster creation, you can get the hostname, port, JDBC connection string from the cluster console. Use them to import into WaveMaker.
