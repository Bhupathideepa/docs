## Bug Fixes

<details> <summary> Canvas related Issues in Markup Tab </summary>

**Cursor issue in Markup Tab**: When writing code in Markup tab where the number of lines of code is more than 250, it was observed that when user made any changes in the markup code and saved it, the scroll and cursor moved back to the top of the page instead of the line where the edit was made.

**Issue with Viewing Changes**: In this case, user was able to see that the whole file is changed even when the changes were minor changes like renaming or updating a line, in view changes.

**Code in Single Line**: Intermitently, upon landing on Markup tab, complete code was displayed in one line until user makes some changes and save them.

<details> <summary> Unwanted Resources are not getting Deleted on Project Restoration </summary>

Previously, when restoring a project, resources (files or folders) missing from the uploaded zip file were not removed from the existing project directory, leaving outdated or unnecessary files behind. The restore process only added or updated resources but didnâ€™t handle deletions.

This issue was fixed by clearing the project folder before extracting the zip file. Now, only the files and folders in the uploaded zip are copied, ensuring the project directory accurately reflects its contents.

This fix removes old or unnecessary files, preventing confusion or any potential issues.

</details>

<details> <summary> Tooltip Value format Issue in Donut Chart </summary>

An issue was observed and fixed in Donut Chart where the y-axis value was not reflecting upon formatting. This issue was noticed when user hovered over the Donut Chart.

</details>

### React Native

<details><summary>Issue with Carousel Dots</summary>

When a Carousel widget has more than 20 windows, the number of dots that appear at the bottom of the page were equal to the number of windows. This issue is now fixed by limiting it to 3 dots and the number of dots can be further customised.

</details>

<details><summary>onOpen Method recalled in Dialog</summary>

An issue was observed when nested Dialog widgets were used where the `onOpen` method was getting called for the first dialog when the second dialog was closed. Now, the `onOpen` method is called for the first dialog only when it is opened for the first time.

</details>

<details><summary> Dialog is appearing without Header </summary>

During preview, the dialogs are appearing without the header as they are opening from the Tabbar section. This was observed only in iOS.
