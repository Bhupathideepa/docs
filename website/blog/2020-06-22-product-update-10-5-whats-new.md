## Deployment to CDN - Well, speed matters!

Ensuring a consistent user experience is important not just in terms of features and looks, but also in terms of speed. With our 10.5 update, we are all set to release a CDN ready setup. All you have to do is nothing different than before. Thanks to our backend team! Now the deployments are done with CDN. To read our blog on this, see [Delivering your apps faster with WaveMaker](/learn/blog/2020/06/23/deliver-faster-applications-with-wavemaker).

## Support for Micro-frontend

In the last update 10.4, we introduced support for building Micro-frontend applications - it is developing smaller apps, and an easy-to-maintain devlopment approach. This architecture style encourages the independent delivery of frontend applications with a Node-based CLI. A CLI helps to convert **[WaveMaker](https://www.wavemakeronline.com/login/login)** apps to **[Single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/)** compatible app. In this release, we updated the version to 3.4 of `single-spa-angular` for better support for Angular 7 projects.

## Data Table Summary Row

A table is an always-preferred mode to handle data or to perform calculations, or even to do a quick analysis. And having to do more with the Data Table adds so much value to this widget. And we are so thrilled to add a summary row function, which is just what you'll need, and probably your new best friend if you love working with Data Table.  To learn how it works, check out the [Data Table Summary Row doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/datatable/summary-row).

Well, that's not it.

Despite all that's happening around, the lockdown has almost no impact on how we deliver our product releases. It wouldn't have happened without our teams' continuous collaboration and team-work!
