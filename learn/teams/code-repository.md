Source code management is a critical part of the project lifecycle, allowing teams to manage their work with a single source of truth. Team includes support for integrating multiple source code repositories with the system so that you have access to source code and control over where your source code resides. It helps in setting up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines. You can add multiple code repositories where the particular project's source code will reside.

-  You can access the code repository page in the administration area by clicking on the **Code Repository** entry in the left panel.
