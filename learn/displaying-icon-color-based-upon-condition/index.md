In WaveMaker many widgets like Panel, Button etc. have a way to display an icon. You can choose the icons from the list of wavicons or font-awesome icons or glyph icons.

You can change the color of the Icon displayed based upon a condition. Here we will see how to change the Icon color based upon selection of a Checkbox:

1. and drop an Icon and a Checkbox widget.
2. the Checkbox widget, set the "checked value" and "unchecked value" as true and false respectively. [![](../assets/icon_color1.png)](../assets/icon_color1.png)
3. on the Icon widget and for the "Icon Class" property click on the bind icon [![](../assets/icon_color2.png)](../assets/icon_color2.png)
4. the expression as below "<glyph class name>" + " " + (Widgets.<checkbox\_name>.datavalue?"first\_calssname":"second\_classname") [![](../assets/icon_color3.png)](../assets/icon_color3.png) In this example the expression, _\-danger_ and _\-info_ are the in-build classes of the product which we used to set the color. You can use your own class (defined in the css file) to set the color property.
