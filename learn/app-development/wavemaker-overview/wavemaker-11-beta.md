As we advance, we firmly believe that WaveMaker is now more than just a low-code platform. Our focus has been on making the application development process as smooth as possible at every single step of the development life cycle, with the ability to integrate many popular open-source products. Plus, flexibility to customize and reuse components-as-a-service. WaveMaker Studio is a versatile power-packed system many developers expect to work with easily.

With WaveMaker 11 beta release, the Studio provides many such capabilities: developing native-ready applications on a single platform, API composer toolkit, and more, keeping low code roots in mind while staying up-to-date with the tech stack.
