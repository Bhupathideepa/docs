*WaveMaker released a new update version with some bug fixes.*

## New Features

---

### Android SDK

- Cordova-Android is upgraded to 10.1.0, which has support for Android-30 SDK. 
- All Cordova plugins are updated to the latest versions.
- All Cordova platform-supported plugins now point to npm instead of GitHub. 

### Prefab Localization

#### Override Prefab locale messages in the application

You can override the values for the Prefab local keys by using the "prefabMessages" object in the I18N folder. 

- For example, a Prefab contains languages including English, Spanish, and Arabic. To edit a prefab message key of Spanish, you override the message keys in the `es.json` file where the prefab messages object is provided, placed in the I18N folder. Similarly, to edit Arabic, you edit the message keys in the `ar.json` file.

#### Handling unsupported Prefab Locale

- Suppose the application supports a locale that Prefab does not support. In that case, the prefab messages are picked from the Prefabs' en.json file for that specific locale in the output folder instead of empty messages. 

#### Merging App and Prefab locale keys

- The generated output folder contains overridden localization keys. You can merge the Prefab messages configured in app locale files and the Prefab locale files.
