[WaveMaker AutoCode](https://www.figma.com/@wavemaker), a Figma plugin, streamlines frontend development by generating WaveMaker-compatible code directly from Figma designs using Material 3.0 and WaveMaker UI Kits. 

Developers can easily edit the generated code in WaveMaker Studio, importing designs for seamless integration and refinement. Within WaveMaker Studio, they can also bind backend APIs and implement business logic, effectively minimizing manual code translation and accelerating development cycles.

#### Highlights

1. The generated code is built with WaveMaker’s enterprise-ready, battle-tested UI component library.
2. Figma variables seamlessly map to CSS variables, capturing light and dark mode settings.
3. On-click navigation and overlay prototypes from Figma turn into real, functional actions in the code.
