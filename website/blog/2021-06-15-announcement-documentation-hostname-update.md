<!-- truncate -->

As a part of brand unification, our digital team has been working hard to create a better online experience for our customers. For this reason, we are moving to a new documentation hostname. 

Starting June 17, 2021, our new domain name for documentation will be **docs.wavemaker.com/learn**. 

If you have subscribed to our documentation blog's RSS feed, we request you to update the news feed with the following URL.

```

Though there are no significant changes in the layout and context, we have made it just a little easier for our customers and clients to find us online and convey a more cohesive brand identity.
