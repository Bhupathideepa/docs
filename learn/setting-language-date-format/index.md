You can set the **Page**, **Language** and **Format** for _and time fields_ in the app from the Project Settings dialog. **Settings** can be accessed from project configurations of the [Workspace](http://[supsystic-show-popup id=107])

: The date/time format set at the widget level will get priority over the Project level setting. : Default Language needs the App Messages to be configured in the selected language. [here for more](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/select-locale-usage/)
