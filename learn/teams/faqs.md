### What are the different types of subscriptions in WaveMaker?


At WaveMaker, we offer the following options including, Solo, Team, and On-Premise.

1. **Solo**

    It's geared towards users who want to get started quickly and do not need to worry about infrastructure and application maintenance. Get immediate access to the latest and greatest features, no work required.
