## Simplify Access Management 

Make anyone a Team admin. Or don’t. The power is yours. Need to add someone to your team? No problem. Search by email address or add anybody by email address, whether they have a WaveMaker account or not. Those new to WaveMaker will receive an invite and get automatically added to your Team.

## Projects Collaboration Seamlessly

It allows to have transparent project tracking across your team. This helps to make sure each member is handling his/her tasks accordingly, in order to stay on track. Sharing projects with your team members is effortless. You can give developers the right access, to the right project, at the right time. Manage and override existing access for specific users.


## Code Repository 

Source code management is a critical part of the project lifecycle, allowing teams to manage their work with a single source of truth. Team includes support for integrating multiple source code repositories with the system so that you have access to source code and control over where your source code resides. It helps in setting up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines.

## Role Management

It provides clarity to your team with well-defined roles & permissions. You can control all roles, role permissions in an easy to customize central place. Customize the access permissions for each role as you want. A user can perform actions on a project based on their assigned role & permissions.

## Team profile

Your team's profile page shows basic information about your team. You can access and update the team's profile.

- **Name** non-editable field giving the name of the team.  
- **Email Domain** only users with these email domains are allowed to be part of the team. You can define an allowlist to restrict the email domains allowed in a user’s Email.  
- **Default Package prefix** defines the default package for the generated code across all projects. It can be changed later for any specific project. This can be modified as per your requirements.
