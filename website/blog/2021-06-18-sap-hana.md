SAP HANA Cloud is a fully managed in-memory and column-based cloud database as a service (DBaaS) offered by SAP that helps in managing your data storage and integration while running powerful applications.

In SAP HANA, the data is completely stored in the main memory, and when the main memory limit is reached, the whole database objects, including table, view, etc., that are not used will be unloaded from the main memory and saved into the disk. For example, in a column store table, data is stored vertically. So, similar data types come together, which provides faster memory read and write operations with the help of the In-Memory Computing Engine.

## SAP HANA in WaveMaker

Tried importing SAP HANA database as the **Other** type in WaveMaker, which was offered in Read mode only? The support of importing the SAP HANA database is now offered in both read and editable modes. Hence, it helps create variables with CRUD capability to develop List, Data Table, and other widgets within a few clicks.

Using the **Connect to DB** option allows you to import the SAP HANA database from the **Databases** menu.

WaveMaker takes care of adding the driver dependency in `pom.xml`. For example, in the following image, consider an employee table imported into the project.

The above table can create List, Data Table widgets, etc., and perform CRUD operations.

### Using SAP Hana DB for Creating a List Widget

Drag and drop the List widget and configure the List widget by selecting the employee table.

After configuring the widget, you can preview the application and view the table data as a list.

You can also create new tables and modify existing tables from the database designer instead of using the SAP HANA console when imported in an editable mode in WaveMaker.

## Don’t have a SAP HANA database?

Below are the steps to launch an SAP HANA instance : 

1. Sign in to SAP HANA cloud central console.
2. Launch an SAP HANA instance with the required memory and other database configurations.
3. After the instance creation, you can get the hostname, port from the SAP HANA database explorer.

## Already have a SAP HANA database?
