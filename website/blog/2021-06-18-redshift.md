Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. You can start with just a few hundred gigabytes of data and scale to a petabyte or more.

With Redshift, you can query and combine exabytes of structured and semi-structured data across your data warehouse, operational database, and data lake using standard SQL. Redshift lets you easily save the results of your queries back to your S3 data lake using open formats, like Apache Parquet, so that you can do additional analytics from other analytics services like Amazon EMR, Amazon Athena, and Amazon SageMaker.

Amazon Redshift achieves efficient storage and optimum query performance through a combination of massively parallel processing, columnar data storage, and very efficient, targeted data compression encoding schemes.
Redshift internally uses PostgreSQL but few features that are available in PostgreSQL have been omitted by Redshift to improve performance.

## Redshift Architecture

![Redshift Architecture](/learn/assets/redshift-architecture.png)

Redshift is a data warehouse cluster which is a combination of nodes. If a cluster has two or more clusters then an additional leader node exists which coordinates between the nodes and handles external communication.
Each compute node has its own dedicated CPU, memory, and attached disk storage, which are determined by the node type. 

A compute node is partitioned into slices. Each slice is allocated a portion of the node's memory and disk space, where it processes a portion of the workload assigned to the node. The leader node manages distributing data to the slices and apportions the workload for any queries or other database operations to the slices. The slices then work in parallel to complete the operation.

### Redshift in WaveMaker

Tried importing redshift database as other type in WaveMaker which is only in read mode? WaveMaker has now added support for importing Redshift database in both read and editable modes and create variables which can be further used to create list, data tables and other widgets.
Redshift database can be now imported from the “Connect to a DB” option in the databases menu.
WaveMaker takes care of adding the driver dependency in pom.xml.
For example, consider an employee table that is imported in the project.

The above table can be used to create list, data table widgets etc and perform CRUD operations on it.
Drag and drop the list widget and configure the list widget by selecting the employee table.

After configuring the widget then the user can preview the application and view the table data as a list.

The user can also create new tables, modify existing tables from the database designer instead of using the redshift console if it is imported in editable mode in WaveMaker.

### Don’t have a redshift database
Below are the steps to launch a redshift cluster : 
1. Sign in to AWS Management console and use the following link to open Amazon Redshift console − https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/
2. Click on create cluster and select the number of nodes, node capacity and other database configurations.
3. After the cluster creation you can get the host name, port, jdbc connection string from the cluster console and use them to import into WaveMaker.

### Already have a Redshift database

You can directly import the redshift database by following the how-to’s doc [Connect To AWS Redshift Database](/learn/how-tos/configuring-aws-redshiftdb#docsNav).
