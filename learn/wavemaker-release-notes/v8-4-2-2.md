## Bug Fixes
---

1.  The issue with the _output_ display format for Date, Time and Datetime widgets getting replaced with project settings display format has been resolved.
2.  The population of the default value in the autocomplete widget when bound to a NULL value resulting in displaying the first record has been resolved.
3.  For an app using MySQL Cloud as database provider, when the user makes any changes to the deployment profile, the password for the SQL Cloud was getting an encoded value instead of retaining the system property. This issue has been addressed.
