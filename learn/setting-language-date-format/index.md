title: "Setting Language and Date Format"
id: ""
---

You can set the **Home Page**, **Default Language** and **Display Format** for _date and time fields_ in the app from the Project Settings dialog. **Project Settings** can be accessed from project configurations of the [Project Workspace](http://[supsystic-show-popup id=107]).

**Note**: The date/time format set at the widget level will get priority over the Project level setting. **Note**: Default Language needs the App Messages to be configured in the selected language. [See here for more](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/select-locale-usage/).
