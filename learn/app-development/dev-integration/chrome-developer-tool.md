**WaveMaker Devtool** is a Google Chrome extension, an addition to the existing Google Chrome developer tools that allow you to debug and monitor WaveMaker applications in preview mode.

### Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser
- Be Logged into the WaveMaker platform to view logs

### Why WaveMaker Devtool

Here are some considerable challenges that WaveMaker developers frequently experience while debugging.

1. Typically, application developers go through many application logs when an issue is observed, that is, when you add new changes to the application and view them in the preview mode. 
2. The developer often misses out on meaningful information to determine which variables are responsible for the request and fix the encountered issue. 

### How Devtool can help

To ease the debugging and improve the application performance, WaveMaker introduced the **WaveMaker Devtool** Google Chrome extension. You can easily identify duplicate requests triggered on the page and check which requests take more time to respond to.

### Who can use WaveMaker Devtool 

All WaveMaker users who use Google Chrome to preview the application can install the **WaveMaker Devtool** extension and use it. 

### Using the WaveMaker Devtool 

Once you install the extension and preview a WaveMaker application on Preview mode, you can view the duplicate requests triggered on the page using the **Show only duplicates** option. You can find the variable associated with each request along with the request URL. By default, the **Core APIs** of the page are shown. Users can switch to **All APIs** to view all the requests triggered by the page.
