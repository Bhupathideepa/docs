WaveMaker has released a version, 11.3.4, containing bug fixes related to user access to a project and loading the project listing page.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue related to user access denial when a user tries to rejoin the WaveMaker Studio project after leaving the project more than once.
- Fixed an issue related to the intermittent appearance of the blank screen and slowness in loading the project listing page in WaveMaker Studio after login or switching between teams.
