#### Optmising the sign up flow

- New users can access the product right after sign up without verifying the email.
- During the time when the email is unverified, adding new users to the project, deploy, exporting the project, push to external git will be disabled.
- During the trial period importing a project into WaveMaker will be disabled.

#### WKWebView is integrated

Apple made it mandatory for all new apps to use WKWebView instead of UIWebView. So, Wavemaker is updated to use WKWebView. For more information, see our [blog on WKWebView](/learn/blog/2020/04/20/wavemaker-wkwebview-upgrade).


#### iOS Upgrade

- iOS apps that use old webview are getting rejected by Apple. In cordova-ios 5.1.1, old webview references were completely removed. So, Wavemaker platform is upgraded to cordova-ios@5.1.1. 
- Wavemaker supported plugins are also updated. 
- Phonegap build does not support cordova-ios@5.1.1 version, yet. Therefore, manual build is necessary for all new app submissions to the App store.

## Deprecation

- Platform support for Mobile Apps on Android Kitkat is deprecated and is going to end in Wavemaker 10.5.

## Bug fixes

---

- Show errors like deleted prefab, wrong font reference in css before deploy process instead of showing deployment failure after long time
- InLine edit of Table should support the same form validation methods that are supported on the form
- Pulling from VCS sometimes would cause the project to become unresponsive
