WaveMaker Release 11.10.1 is here with significant enhancements like Validations for OpenID Security Provider and Configurable Tap and Ripple Effect in React Native. This release also includes many major bug fixes from both Web and React Native platforms.

## Enhancements

<details><summary> Validations for OpenID Security Provider </summary>

With release 11.10.1, we have added validation checks for providerId in the OpenID security configuration within the Security Providers section. These validations ensure that the providerId only allows lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and underscore as special character.

Additionally, a check is added for the **Enable Provider** toggle option of the security providers. When trying to disable the last active provider, the system prevents this action to ensure that at least one provider remains enabled at all times.
