*Introduction to WaveMaker; the Low-code platform and RAD (Rapid Application Development). Learn and develop apps using WM Studio.*

---

[WaveMaker](https://www.wavemaker.com/) is a low-code platform for developing enterprise apps. It is a design studio with over [80 widgets](/learn/app-development/widgets/widget-library) that work out-of-the-box for developing a rich and modern end-to-end application. Simply drag-and-drop UI components on dashboard and integrate it with data and services. 

:::tip
To learn about Widgets, see the [Widgets](/learn/app-development/widgets/ui-elements) documentation.

WaveMaker apps are built on the concept called [variables](/learn/app-development/variables/variables-actions). You can create simple to complex variables with data and services. Integrate it with UI components in a few clicks and it is done. Also, you can extend your app using APIs, web services, or write your own code to extend an original feature. 

In addition, WaveMaker is also a simple-to-use solution for building apps faster with one-click deployment. In this section, you can find a complete developers' guide for building apps in WaveMaker Studio.
