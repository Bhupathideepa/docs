WaveMaker has released a patch version, 11.3.3, containing new features in React Native and other bug fixes.

## React Native

- In Prefabs, use third-party React Native UI components as a Custom widget, enabling you to add advanced features to your applications for more customizability.
- Introduced a new widget called "**Lottie**" using Lottie JSON files. You can provide the file path of the Lottie JSON as the input source, and the widget will render the animation in your application. 
- Fixed Form submit with console errors.


## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue related to the DataTable UI, misalignment when the table data is refreshed, particularly when Row Expansion is applied.
