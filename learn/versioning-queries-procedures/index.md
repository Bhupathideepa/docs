title: "Versioning of Queries and Procedures"

8.4.1 release, WaveMaker has changed field naming strategy for result columns of queries and procedures. This has resulted in two versions of Queries and Procedures for backward compatibility:

- 1 for older/existing query/procedures and
- 2 for query/procedure created post-release 8.4.1

Following is how WaveMaker implements these two versions:

- service layer with suffix **\_V1** is generated for all services having old query or procedures to handle backward compatibility due to method signature changes in the new service layer. For eg: _\_V1_ Changes:
    - service always returned _<Object>_ for select query. But new service returns _<<queryName>Response>_
    - old service, all parameters were configured as method arguments but in the new service, for INSERT/UPDATE parameters, are wrapped in Request class.
- controller always uses latest service layer i.e
- existing Java services are migrated to use V1 service layer instead of the new service to handle backward compatibility.
    - most of the cases existing Java, services will work as before but there might be a chance of  due to Runtime type casts i.e casting returned column value to the desired type.
    - fix above-mentioned we recommend migration of all existing Java services to use latest Query/Procedure Executor service instead of V1.

: Because of design time POJO generation, if any query/procedure meta is updated then the execution will fail at compile time rather than at Runtime. This will save a lot of testing and debug time.

can easily read the response data with the help of POJO classes. All properties can be accessed using getters instead of map.get.s

### to V2

**for manual Java Service Migration/Using latest Services**

1. query/procedure service class (i.e Query/ProcedureExecutorService) by using @Autowired.
2. existing Java services, you can either modify the class name from Query/ProcedureExecutorService\_V1 to Query/ProcedureExecutorService or inject a new field.
3. can execute query/procedures in the same way.
    - type changed to Page instead of Page<Object> for SELECT queries.
    - type changed for INSERT/UPDATE queries to <queryName>Request.
    - SELECT queries Pageable argument moved to last.
    - Procedures return type changed to <procedureName>Response instead of List<procedureNameResponse>
    - type changed for methods starting “create”, “add”, “build”, “edit”, “set”, “update” with <procedureName>Request.
