WaveMaker strives to provide the best possible experience to all our users by regularly enhancing and upgrading our products. With this in mind, we are excited to announce the upcoming release of WaveMaker Version 11.4, which will introduce various new features and improvements, such as React Native features, tightly-coupled team collaboration, and reimport of backend APIs, and more exciting features. 

See whatâ€™s in [WaveMaker 11](https://docs.wavemaker.com/learn/app-development/wavemaker-overview/wavemaker-11).

## What will happen?

However, with the release of Version 11.4, we will officially discontinue support for WaveMaker Version 10 projects. This decision is aligned with our commitment to delivering the latest technology and ensuring that our users can benefit from the most up-to-date and secure features. As part of this transition, we will be ending support for WaveMaker 10.x projects by September 4, 2023.

## What Should You Do?

After the 11.4 release, our support team will no longer provide assistance or updates for projects running on Version 10. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you plan to migrate your projects to the latest version to continue receiving support and leverage the latest functionalities.

### Migrating from WaveMaker 10.x to 11.x

:::important

If you do not migrate your projects to 11.x, your projects will automatically be migrated to the latest released version i.e. 11.4.x. We recommend you initiate the upgrade to take full control of your project migration and plan it accordingly. For more information, see the release information.

:::

To aid you in the process of migration, we have prepared detailed documentation on migrating from Version 10 to the latest Version 11.x. To get started with the migration process, see [Updating an App from WaveMaker 10 WaveMaker 11](https://docs.wavemaker.com/learn/how-tos/upgrade-guide-wavemaker-10-to-11).

### Upgrade In-progress: Archived Apps

It is recommended to complete the migration from WaveMaker 10 to WaveMaker 11.x before the 11.4 release, in case you do not update the project before the planned migration date of 11.4, two things will happen:

1. WaveMaker 10 projects that have not been migrated will be force-migrated to 11.4.
2. WaveMaker 11 Migration in-progress projects will be moved to the Archived apps.

To avoid forced migration from WaveMaker 10 to WaveMaker 11, complete the process before 4th September 2023. In case of any assistance, reach out to our **support team**.
