## Highlights

We are ready with another minor release version 11.3.0. 

### Prefab Marketplace


WaveMaker now allows you to publish Prefab to Marketplace, furnishing independent software vendors to achieve productivity of the developers, enabling them to reuse each other's code by letting you explore Prefabs and discover different teams for collaboration.

### Semantic Versioning of Artifact


By allowing Publish to Marketplace, WaveMaker enables the use of Semantic Versioning for artifact publishing. This is a globally recognized standard for publishing package models, allowing the developers to track versions for software integration and more. 

### Lottie File Support

In this release, we bring you some facets of mobile app design; an ability to add animations including Lottie file support. This enables you to produce a delightful experience for the app user and achieve consumer-grade applications.
