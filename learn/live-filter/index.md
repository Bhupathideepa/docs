**Filter** provides data filtering UI and functionality.Â Live Filter can be bound to a data source from the database through the Database CRUD Variable. It returns filtered results which in turn can be bound to any widget. When designing in WaveMaker, Live Filter offers the following features to be configured:

- fields style and display formats,
- the range filtering for numeric fields,
- the number of records to be filtered,
- behavior in case of empty or null results,
- the match mode,
- a cascading filter,
- layout styles like 1-column, 2-column or 3-column
