WaveMaker 11.7.1 is here with a new feature, Pull Request (PR) Flow. This release also includes enhancements like Internationalization (i18n) message customization, extended Semantic Versioning, disabling Prefab editing in a project, and other bug fixes.

## New Features

### Pull Request Flow

To support development collaboration, WaveMaker introduced developer branching. Now, when a user pushes code, a development branch is created in the code repository. With this, the changes pushed by the developer can be reviewed instead of automatically merging the changes to the Remote Tracking Branch (RTB).

## Enhancements

### Full Semantic Version Support for Prefabs Publishing

Earlier we used to support the Semantic versioning to publish an Artifact that included the Major.Minor.Patch details of the artifact. Now, we have extended this support to add the Pre-release and build details of the Artifact. For example, 1.2.1-beta+1234, where,

- **1**: Major
- **2**: Minor
- **1**: Patch
- **beta**: Pre-release
- **1234**: Build

### Disable Prefab editing inside the Application

With this support, users need to apply their code changes in the Prefab project and publish the changes to use the Prefab in any application as we are disabling the support to edit the Prefab code within the application.

### Internationalization Message Customization in Prefabs used in a Project

Now, we have extended our support to allow the editing of i18n Prefab messages within the project. This eliminates the need to manually edit the messages in the en.json or af.json files available in File Explorer, making it easier to customize the Prefab messages inside the project.

### Label Widget Enhancement

To enhance accessibility in the Label widget, we are replacing the use of the `<label>` tag with `<h1>` to `<h6>`, and `<p>` tags, depending on the selected layout option. By default, the `<p>` tag will be used, as the `<label>` tag is primarily suited for use in forms.

To enhance accessibility for **Label** used in any widget, we are replacing the use of the `<label>` tag with `<h1>` to `<h6>`, and `<p>` tags, depending on the selected layout. By default, the `<p>` tag is used to replace the `<label>` tag. 

:::note

No changes in the usage of the Label widget in Forms. It works as before.

## Other Improvements

### Support for Runtime Version Switching in New Studio

Runtime patches are used to address bugs or regression issues in the runtime of both Web and React Native applications. They are easy to apply and with this feature, it becomes easy to revert to another runtime version. Without any downtime, the user can roll back to previous deployment versions.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the landing page visible upon logging in is now determined by the priority settings specified in the App Roles section when the user is assigned multiple roles.
- Fixed project runtime version defaulting to base runtime version when a new user joins or a branch project created in a project using supported runtime version.
- Fixed an issue where the user was unable to view the branch name when the branch name was provided in the Search field to publish a Prefab.
- Fixed an issue where the Web template bundle was not supported in the New Studio.
- Fixed an issue while creating a Model variable where the input field values got erased once the Type field value was erased.
- Fixed an issue in the API Service Import section where the Add and Delete icons were visible in the projects with role permissions set to Default.
- Fixed error handling issue by adding proper error message when accessing Prefab resources.
- Fixed an issue in React Native and Cordova Zip generation where the profile name was not taken during the Maven build when passed using -P.
- Fixed an issue where the page content scrolled down when using the Tab widget.
- Fixed an issue while using multiple Panel widgets where on preview the action items in the first panel were in focus even if the action items in the next panel were selected.
- Fixed an issue in the Date widget where the Date pattern and Output format fields were not getting reflected in the Markup section.
- Fixed an issue during Profile configuration where the user was unable to add environmental variables under the App Environment section.
- Fixed an issue where the New User table values were not being properly aligned when the user was assigned multiple roles after setting a security provider.
- Fixed an issue related to the imported Swagger file where the hostname was asked while saving changes in the Profile Configuration section.
- Fixed an issue where the user was unable to perform any VCS action and it threw multiple console errors while creating a Partial page by adding the page markup.
