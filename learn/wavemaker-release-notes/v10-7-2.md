*WaveMaker releases an update with bug fixes.*

## Improvements

---

- Improved the format of the **Currency** and **Number** widgets to support natural and financial modes by setting the **Input Mode** property.
- For the **Upload widget**, added the ability to aptly highlight the dropzone when using the drag and drop approach.

## Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed an issue related to the `mvn clean install` build failing for the projects stored in D or E drives.
- Fixed an issue related to the List widget's `getIndex()` method returning -1 even when you pass a valid input.

### Data Table

- Fixed an issue related to an error **No data found** while loading data when multi-filter is enabled and contained multiple Datetime widgets.

#### Quick Edit Mode in Data Table

- Fixed an issue related to editing a row. When you select rows and click on a column cell to edit, it selects the next row inline to the previously edited one instead of the clicked one.
- Fixed an issue related to select and deselect events triggering twice when selecting and working in two separate rows.
- Fixed an issue related to the value in the number widget incrementing from zero instead of incrementing from the specified input.
- Fixed an issue related to the keyboard keys not working after saving a row, including arrow, escape and enter keys.
