*Introduction to WaveMaker; the Low-code platform and RAD (Rapid Application Development). Learn and develop apps using WM Studio.*

---

[WaveMaker](https://www.wavemaker.com/) is a low-code platform for developing enterprise apps. It is a design studio with over [80 widgets](/learn/app-development/widgets/widget-library) that work out-of-the-box for developing a rich and modern end-to-end application. Simply drag-and-drop UI components on dashboard and bind them with data and services. 

WaveMaker apps are built on the concept called [variables](/learn/app-development/variables/variables-actions). You can create simple to complex variables which contain data and services. You bind them with the UI in a few clicks and done. Also, you can extend your app using APIs, web services, or write your own code to extend an original feature. 

In addition, WaveMaker is also a simple-to-use solution for building apps faster with one-click deployment. In this section, you can find a complete developers' guide for building apps in WaveMaker Studio.
