They can also be bound to a database CRUD or query via Java service/Web service and used to perform CRUD operations through API calls.

Form fields are auto-generated from the service variable input parameters to which it is bound and can be configured to:

- represented by appropriate widgets,
- field input validation,
- form field data;
- actions like editing and saving the form fields and adding a new record;
- layout styles like 1-column, 2-columns or 3-columns.
