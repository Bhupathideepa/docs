## New Features

<details><summary>Migration to Standalone Components in Angular</summary>

With this release, users can see the transition from module-based architecture to standalone components in generated Angular applications. Due to this transition, users can use Standalone components that allow users to build applications without the rigid structure of modules.

**Why this transition?**

Benefits of this transition from module-based architecture to standalone components are,

- Simplified development process of angular applications.
- Improved performance with faster load time
- Enhanced reusability using Standalone components.
- Facilitates Tree-shaking optimization.

**Impact on Generated Applications**

​Starting with WaveMaker Release v11.11, generated Angular applications have transitioned to using standalone components, replacing traditional NgModules. This shift aligns with Angular's latest best practices, simplifying application structure and reducing boilerplate code.​

Key changes include:

- The `app.module` file is no longer generated.
- The App config file is generated to manage application dependencies.
- Page-level modules are eliminated, reducing the number of files in the application.
- Each page component is now a standalone component, lazily loaded upon routing.
- Application startup utilizes the modern `bootstrapApplication()` API, leveraging main.ts and app.config.ts for configuration, thereby removing the need for a root AppModule.

<details><summary>Differentiating User Changes and Migration Changes in Studio</summary>

Studio's new feature for differentiating user changes from migration changes during project upgrades offers significant benefits, enhancing the development workflow while ensuring compatibility with the latest tech stack and latest Studio practices.

**Benefits of Differentiating Changes**

**Enhanced Transparency:** By clearly separating user modifications from migration updates, developers gain a better understanding of the migration changes, reducing confusion and the risk of unintentionally reverting essential updates.​

**Efficient Troubleshooting:** When issues arise post-migration, being able to understand and locate whether a change was user-initiated or part of the migration process helps in quicker diagnosis and resolution.​

**Streamlined Maintenance:** Maintaining applications becomes easier and clearer when developers can focus on user-specific changes without being distracted by migration modifications.​

**Reduced Errors:** Clear differentiation minimizes the risk of accidental overwrites or deletions of critical migration updates, leading to more stable and reliable applications.​​

**New UI Tabs for Change Differentiation**

In the “View Project Changes” window, users now find three tabs:

**User Changes** – Only shows files changed by the user.
**Migration Changes** – Lists all changes made by Studio as part of the migration.
**Overall Changes** – This shows a combined view of both migration and user changes.
**Changes Since Last Pushed (only when PR flow is enabled):** This shows changes made after the last push.

<details><summary>Dynamic Wizard Widget</summary>

Introducing Dynamic Wizard widget that allows users to build flexible, multi-step forms that adapt based on data and user context. Key capabilities include:

**Auto-Generated Steps:** Wizard steps and content can be dynamically created from datasets or JSON objects, making the widget reusable across varying scenarios.

**Partial Content Support:** Each step can load different templates or HTML content available in a Partial.

**Dynamic Forms:** Each wizard step can contain dynamic form that adapts to user data, allowing flexible input fields and validation.

**Custom Navigation:** Developers can set a default starting step, jump to specific steps, and track the current step index.

**Real-Time Step Management:** Add and remove steps dynamically based on user actions or logic.

**Context Awareness:** Easily identify the first or last step to disable buttons or trigger special actions.

These features make the wizard highly customizable, enhancing user experience and improving multi-step forms handling in dynamic workflows. To know the steps to implement, see.

## Enhancements

<details><summary>Improved Canvas Visual</summary>

This release introduces a significantly enhanced WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) canvas, ensuring that the design environment closely mirrors the live application. This update addresses previous challenges such as text overflow, unintuitive component names, and misaligned layouts.​

**Key Improvements:**

**WYSIWYG Accuracy:** The canvas now accurately reflects the live application's fonts, spacing, padding, and alignment, providing a seamless design-to-preview experience.​

**Enhanced Text Handling:** Text elements are intelligently managed to prevent overflow, maintaining a clean and organized canvas.​

**Meaningful Component Naming:** Components are now auto-named based on their binding expressions, offering clearer context and easier navigation within the layout.​

**Benefits:**

- Reduces time spent on fixing layout inconsistencies.​
- Streamlines the design-to-preview workflow.
- Enhances confidence in the design process, ensuring that what is seen during development matches the end-user experience.​

<details><summary>Optimizing Angular Applications by Cleaning Up Unused i18n Files</summary>

To optimize Angular application performance and reduce bundle size, it's crucial to eliminate unused localization files from libraries like Moment.js, @angular/global, and FullCalendar. By adopting this approach, users can significantly enhance Angular application's performance, leading to faster load times and a better user experience.

**How to Remove Unused Locales**

**Moment.js:** Utilize the moment-locales-webpack-plugin to specify which locales to include, effectively excluding the rest .​

**@angular/global:** Implement a pre-build script to include only the required locales in the angular.json configuration, preventing Angular from copying all locale files during the build process.​

**FullCalendar:** Manually import only the necessary locale files instead of the entire set, ensuring that only the needed locales are bundled.


**Performance Testing Results after Optimization**

- A 25% reduction in finish time.
- A 35% decrease in load time on Fast 4G networks.

Disk usage of existing and updated apps are shown below.
