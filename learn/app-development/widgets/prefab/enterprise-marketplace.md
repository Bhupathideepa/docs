## Enterprise Marketplace

Enterprise marketplace allows artifacts to be published so that other teams can use them. WaveMaker for Teams already has the feature to publish artifacts within the team. Now, with this feature each team will be able to share any artifact with any other team as well.

:::note
Enterprise Marketplace is available only with WaveMaker Enterprise version of the product and not available on wavemakeronline.com
:::

WaveMaker developers can view the list of prefabs that are published to Enterprise Marketplace in studio when they press the '+' icon present in the Prefabs section.

## Semantic Versioning

WaveMaker supports versioning system to name the releases. Semantic versioning is a univerally accepted versioning scheme that is already followed by many software publishers. With WaveMaker 11.3, the support extends to follow semantic versioning for Artifacts, including Prefabs.

An example of semantic versioning is as shown below.
